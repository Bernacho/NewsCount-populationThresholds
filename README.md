# NewsCounts-populationThresholds

The information obtained from the 2020 Census will determine, among other things, funding distribution, grants assignments and the general organization of towns and cities.

At NewsCounts we searched the codes of each state for population thresholds that determine whether a city receives certain funding or certain rights. To do so we used the [FindLaw website](https://codes.findlaw.com/) to search for such thresholds. First we scraped FindLaw website, saved the results into a CSV and then searched that CSV file for the most useful codes.

A more detailed explanation of the project can be found at [here](https://bernacho.github.io/NewsCounts-populationThresholds/populationThresholds.html).
