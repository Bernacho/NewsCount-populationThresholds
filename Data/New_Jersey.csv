New Jersey Statutes Title 48. Public Utilities 48 § 12-57,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-48-public-utilities/nj-st-sect-48-12-57.html,"
a. Every railroad company shall place on each engine a bell weighing not less than 30 pounds which shall be rung continuously in approaching a grade crossing of a highway, beginning at a distance of at least 300 yards from the crossing and continuing until the engine has crossed such highway, or a whistle or horn operated by steam, air or electricity, which shall be sounded, except in cities, at least 300 yards from the crossing and at intervals until the engine has crossed the highway.
For every default the company operating such road shall pay a penalty of $100.00 to be sued for by any informer within 10 days after such penalty was incurred,  1/2 to go to the informer and  1/2 to the county wherein such default occurred.  Nothing herein shall take away any remedy for such neglect from any person injured thereby.
Upon application from the governing body of a county or municipality in which a grade crossing is located, the Commissioner of Transportation may, in his discretion, exempt railroad companies from observing the provisions of this section with respect to grade crossings in that county or municipality employing supplementary safety measures which have been approved by the Federal Railroad Administration or the Secretary of Transportation of the United States pursuant to 
49 U.S.C.s. 20153
 as fully compensating for the absence of the warning provided by the locomotive horn and which have received a waiver or exemption under 
49 U.S.C.s. 20153(d)
.
As used in this act, “supplementary safety measure” means a safety system or procedure, provided by the appropriate traffic control authority or law enforcement authority responsible for safety at the highway-rail grade crossing, that is determined by the Secretary of Transportation of the United States to be an effective substitute for the locomotive horn in the prevention of highway-rail casualties.  A traffic control arrangement that prevents careless movement over the crossing, for example, as where adequate median barriers prevent movement around crossing gates extending over the full width of the lanes in the particular direction of travel, and that conforms to standards prescribed by the Secretary, shall be deemed to constitute a supplementary safety measure.  However, the following do not, individually, or in combination, constitute supplementary safety measures:  standard traffic control devices or arrangements such as reflectorized crossbucks, stop signs, flashing lights, flashing lights with gates that do not completely block travel over the line of railroad, or traffic signals.


b. With respect to that portion of a rail passenger line located in a county of the second class having a population between 420,000 and 425,000, according to the most recent federal decennial census, running between a municipality having a population between 15,100 and 15,125, according to the most recent federal decennial census, and a municipality having a population between 19,940 and 19,965, according to the most recent federal decennial census, upon application of a municipality in which a grade crossing of such line is located, the Commissioner of Transportation shall require that a railroad company or entity providing rail passenger service not sound a whistle or horn in that municipality between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., but instead require that a bell weighing not less than 30 pounds be rung between such hours at such grade crossing location as required by subsection a. of this section, except that notwithstanding this requirement an operator shall not be subject to a penalty for sounding a whistle or horn in an emergency.



c. With respect to that portion of a rail passenger line located in a county of the first class having a population more than 825,000, according to the most recent federal decennial census, running through a municipality having a population between 30,530 and 30,560, according to the most recent federal decennial census, a municipality having a population between 9,850 and 9,900, according to the most recent federal decennial census, a municipality having a population between 10,870 and 10,900, according to the most recent federal decennial census, a municipality having a population between 3,900 and 3,950, according to the most recent federal decennial census, a municipality having a population between 17,890 and 17,920, according to the most recent federal decennial census, a municipality having a population between 7,030 and 7,060, according to the most recent federal decennial census, a municipality having a population between 11,980 and 12, 020, according to the most recent federal decennial census, a municipality having a population between 24,140 and 24,170, according to the most recent federal decennial census, a municipality having a population between 9,755 and 9,760, according to the most recent federal decennial census, a municipality having a population between 9,230 and 9,260, according to the most recent federal decennial census, and a municipality having a population between 15,360 and 15,400, according to the most recent federal decennial census, upon application of a municipality in which a grade crossing of such line is located, the Commissioner of Transportation shall require that a railroad company or entity providing rail passenger service not sound a whistle or horn in that municipality between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m., but instead require that a bell weighing not less than 30 pounds be rung between such hours at any such grade crossing location, except that notwithstanding this requirement, an operator shall not be subject to a penalty for sounding a whistle or horn in an emergency.

a. While the cost of housing in New Jersey has declined under currently eroding economic conditions, the cost of both renting and homeownership remains unaffordable to a large percentage of New Jersey residents, including those who make vital contributions to their communities such as teachers, nurses, police officers, firefighters, and the general workforce population;


b. In recognition of this crisis, Governor Jon S. Corzine has committed to producing and preserving 100,000 units of affordable housing for low-, moderate- and middle-income families and individuals over the next 10 years;


c. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 55 percent of these families are one and two person households, many of which are unable to find homes and apartments designed to meet their needs;


d. While no policy is singularly responsible for current housing conditions, zoning practices have resulted in a lack of land approved for housing which meets the needs of households requiring smaller housing units;


e. The shortage of affordably priced workforce housing has been exacerbated in recent years by a municipal preference for age-restricted housing which has resulted in an oversupply of age-restricted housing approvals and an inability among the majority of New Jersey's workforce to live near their jobs;


f. (Deleted by amendment, 
P.L.2013, c. 253
.)


g. Although the maximum municipal percentage of affordable fair share housing which may be met by age-restricted units in a municipality has been reduced from 50 percent to 25 percent under the recently adopted rules of the Council on Affordable Housing, a mechanism is needed to permit an age-restricted development to change to a converted development to meet this rule, and to meet demographic needs;  and


h. Under currently deteriorating national economic conditions, it is appropriate to take immediate action at this time to create the opportunity to increase the production and supply of workforce housing through the conversion of the over-supplied age-restricted market to meet the needs of New Jersey's residents who require smaller, more reasonably priced homes.

b. A special law enforcement officer shall not carry a firearm except while engaged in the actual performance of the officer's official duties and when specifically authorized by the chief of police, or, in the absence of the chief, other chief law enforcement officer of the local unit to carry a firearm and provided that the officer has satisfactorily completed the basic firearms course required by the commission for regular police officers and annual requalification examinations as required for permanent, regularly appointed full-time officers in the local unit.
A special law enforcement officer shall be deemed to be on duty only while the officer is performing the public safety functions on behalf of the local unit pursuant to this act and when the officer is receiving compensation, if any, from the local unit at the rates or stipends as shall be established by ordinance.  A special law enforcement officer shall not be deemed to be on duty for purposes of this act while performing private security duties for private employers, which duties are not assigned by the chief of police, or, in the absence of the chief, other chief law enforcement officer of the local unit, or while receiving compensation for those duties from a private employer.  A special law enforcement officer may, however, be assigned by the chief of police or, in the absence of the chief, other chief law enforcement officer, to perform public safety functions for a private entity if the chief of police or other chief law enforcement officer supervises the performance of the public safety functions.  If the chief of police or other chief law enforcement officer assigns the public safety duties and supervises the performance of those duties, then, notwithstanding that the local unit is reimbursed for the cost of assigning a special law enforcement officer at a private entity, the special law enforcement officer shall be deemed to be on duty.

C.52:17B-66 et seq.
), shall be credited towards the 280 hours of training required to be completed by this section.  Any training required by this section shall commence within 90 days of the effective date of P.L.1985, c. 45 or within 90 days of the date of the appointment of the special law enforcement officer, whichever is later.


c. A special law enforcement officer shall be under the supervision and direction of the chief of police or, in the absence of the chief, other chief law enforcement officer of the local unit wherein the officer is appointed, and shall perform the officer's duties only in the local unit except when in fresh pursuit of any person pursuant to chapter 156 of Title 2A of the New Jersey Statutes or when authorized to perform duties in another unit pursuant to a mutual aid agreement enacted in accordance with section 1 of P.L.1976, c. 45 (
C.40A:14-156.1
).


d. The officer shall comply with the rules and regulations applicable to the conduct and decorum of the permanent, regularly appointed police officers of the local unit, as well as any rules and regulations applicable to the conduct and decorum of special law enforcement officers.

C.40A:14-146.8 et seq.
) to the contrary, a special law enforcement officer may travel through another local unit to reach a noncontiguous area of the local unit in which the officer's appointment was issued or to transport persons to and from a correctional facility.

a. The number of inhabitants of each constituent district shall be determined as shown by the last federal census officially promulgated in this State.


b. A representative ratio shall be calculated by adding the number of inhabitants of all constituent districts and dividing the sum by the board size.


c. All constituent districts shall be listed in ascending order of their number of inhabitants.  If the first constituent district in said list has a number of inhabitants which is less than the representative ratio, it shall be combined with the constituent district contiguous to it having the smallest number of inhabitants.  This process shall be repeated for each successively larger constituent district or combination of constituent districts until all remaining constituent districts or combinations of constituent districts shall have a number of inhabitants equal to, or exceeding the representative ratio.  The districts formed in this manner shall be known as representative districts.


d. There shall be established a priority list according to the method of equal proportions for the apportionment of the members of the regional district board of education among the representative districts.


e. The members of the regional district board of education shall be apportioned among the representative districts according to the method of equal proportions, and where a representative district is composed of more than one constituent district, members shall be elected at large from within the representative district.


f. The number of inhabitants of each representative district shall be divided by the number of members assigned to that district to find the number of inhabitants per member.


g. The vote to be cast by each member of the regional district board of education in all proceedings of the board shall be determined by dividing the number of inhabitants per member in the representative district from which the member is elected by the representative ratio for the regional district, and rounding off the quotient to the nearest tenth of a full vote.
Wherever any statute or bylaw of the board requires decision in any matter by vote of a majority of the board members, or of the members present, this shall be interpreted as meaning a majority of the weighted votes of all members, or of the members present, as the case may be.


h. Whenever the above reapportionment procedure is used for a regional district having more than nine constituent districts, the terms of office of all incumbent board of education members shall terminate on the day on which the annual organization meeting of the board is held pursuant to 
N.J.S.18A:13-12
 following certification by the executive county superintendent of the representative districts and the number of members to be elected from each;  provided, that if the reapportionment results in any representative district retaining its former boundaries and the same number of board members, that the members elected from such a district shall serve the full term for which they were elected.  All other board members shall be elected in an election to be held on the date of the annual school election at least 60 days following certification by the executive county superintendent for initial terms of office to be designated in advance by the executive county superintendent so that, as nearly as possible, one-third of the board shall be elected in each future year, to serve for three-year terms, and where a representative district has more than one member, their terms of office shall terminate in different years.
If any constituent district is a consolidated district, or a district composed of two or more municipalities, and


a. The original district is a limited purpose regional district and such constituent district has such population that it is entitled to have apportioned to it a number of members equal to or greater than the number of districts making up such constituent district, or


b. The regional district is an all purpose district, the membership of the regional board of education from such district shall be apportioned, and from time to time reapportioned, and the members from the district shall be elected, as their respective terms expire, in the same manner as though each of the municipalities making up such constituent district were constituent districts of the regional district.

(2) The percentage of municipal road mileage in such municipality to the total municipal road mileage in the State;

to the sum of three million, nine hundred fifty thousand dollars ($3,950,000.00) set aside in accordance with the provisions of this section;  provided, however, that the amount of such State aid available hereunder to any municipality in any year shall in no event be less than the average annual amount of State aid allotted to such municipality under the provisions of this chapter during the ten-year period commencing with the calendar year one thousand nine hundred and thirty-six;  nor more than either such average annual amount or thirty-eight per centum (38%) of the average annual expenditures of such municipality, exclusive of State aid, as shown in the annual budgets of such municipality, for the purposes hereinabove provided, during the five-year period commencing with the calendar year one thousand nine hundred and forty-one, whichever is the greater.


(1) The percentage of population in such municipality to the total population of the State based upon the latest official Federal census;  and


(2) The percentage of municipal road mileage in such municipality to the total municipal road mileage in the State;


E. The total amount of such State aid available to all municipalities in any county of the State, for the purposes hereinabove provided, shall not, in any year be less than the sum of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00).
If, in any year, the total amount of such State aid available to all municipalities in any county of the State shall, as determined by the method prescribed in subsection D of this section, be less than the sum of one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00), then the amount which shall be available to each municipality in such county, as determined by the method prescribed in subsection D of this section, shall be increased proportionately so that the aggregate amount of such State aid available to all of the municipalities in such county shall total one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000.00).


F. It shall be lawful for each municipality to include the amount of such State aid made available for it in its budget.  All such amount shall be available to the State Highway Commissioner for allotment to said municipalities in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.  Commitments may be made, subject to the provisions of this chapter, against said amounts by said municipalities, immediately after the beginning of the calendar year next ensuing the date of notification by the State Highway Commissioner as required by the provisions of subsection D of this section.


G. All roads, works and improvements constructed or reconstructed in any municipality with State aid under this chapter shall be maintained by such municipality in accordance with such standards as the State Highway Commissioner shall prescribe.

Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the general power of the municipal council under this act to establish, alter and abolish offices, boards and commissions in any municipality other than a city of the first class.

New Jersey Statutes Title 49. Sale of Securities 49 § 2A-2,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-49-sale-of-securities/nj-st-sect-49-2a-2.html,"
a. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
26 U.S.C. s.145
s.146 et seq., as amended, by the “Tax Reform Act of 1986,” 
Pub.L. 99-514
, and as thereafter amended, hereinafter referred to as the “Code,” imposes an annual limitation on the volume of tax-exempt private activity bonds and the private activity portion of governmental bonds issued after August 15, 1986.


b. The Code limits the annual volume of tax-exempt private activity bonds and the private activity portion of governmental bonds for the State of New Jersey to $75.00 per resident for calendar year 1987 and $50.00 per resident for calendar years, thereafter, based on the most recent population estimate provided by the Bureau of the Census before the beginning of the calendar year to which the limitation applies.


c. The use of tax-exempt bonds is an effective and necessary method of financing programs for housing, water supply, sewerage treatment, hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, solid waste disposal, resource recovery and economic development, and such financing promotes and improves the health, safety, welfare and quality of life of the residents of the State.


d. The Code establishes a formula for allocation of the volume cap which, pursuant to subsection (e) of section 146 of the Code, was subject to temporary modification by gubernatorial executive order until December 31, 1987.  The Code also permits the State to establish by law an alternative formula for allocating the volume cap.


e. In accordance with the Code, the Governor by Executive Orders No. 147 of 1986 and No. 185 of 1988, has heretofore established procedures for the allocation of the State's volume cap on private activity bonds and the private activity portion of governmental bonds within the State under the interim authority provided by the Code.


f. There is a Statewide need to assure that the limited amount of tax-exempt private activity bond financing available is used in the most effective manner by issuers of bonds in the State in order to provide the greatest benefits to the State, and that need can best be met by authorizing the Governor to continue to allocate portions of the State's volume cap among issuers.



g. The Code as amended further provides for annual limitations on the volume of other types of tax-exempt bonds or taxable bonds issued by governmental entities which may have the benefit of certain tax credits or tax subsidies.  Specifically, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, 
Pub.L. No.111-5
, further amended and supplemented the Code to provide for the issuance of certain tax-exempt, tax-credit and tax subsidy types of bonds, including “Recovery Zone Facility Bonds,” “Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds,” “Qualified School Construction Bonds,” “Qualified Zone Academy Bonds” and “Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds.”  These types of bonds are intended to finance programs to facilitate the economic recovery of the nation, contain limitations on the amount which can be issued throughout the nation and therefore require an allocation of such national limitation among the several states, including the State of New Jersey.




h. There is a Statewide need to assure that the limited amount of tax-exempt private activity bond financing and other types of tax-exempt, tax-credit or tax subsidy bond financing which are now authorized under the Code or may be authorized under the Code in the future, is used in the most effective manner by issuers of bonds in the State in order to provide the greatest benefits to the State, and that need can best be met by authorizing the Governor to continue to allocate portions of the State's volume cap among issuers.

(1) The exemption from all fees and charges for the disposal of solid waste generated within the boundaries of the municipality;


(2) The receipt of a lump sum cash payment;  or


(3) Any combination thereof.



(1) The exemption from all fees and charges for the disposal of solid waste generated within the boundaries of the municipality;


(2) The receipt of a lump sum cash payment;  or


(3) Any combination thereof.


c. Every owner or operator of a sanitary landfill facility required to make annual payments to a municipality qualifying pursuant to subsection a. of this section may petition the Department of Environmental Protection for an increase in its tariff which reflects these payments.  The department, within 60 days of the receipt of the petition, shall issue an appropriate order that these payments shall be passed along to the users of the sanitary landfill facility as an automatic surcharge on any tariff filed with, and recorded by, the department for the solid waste disposal operations of the facility.


d. In issuing any order required by this section, the Department of Environmental Protection shall be exempt from the provisions of

P.L.1999, c. 61
 (
C.54:4-8.76 et seq.
).  Each residential property shall receive a reduction in the total property tax obligation during each calendar year in which the local unit receives aid based on the regional services that are entered into by the local units serving the residential property.  Aid shall be granted for each calendar year during which a regional service agreement is in effect.  This program shall be known as the “Regional Efficiency Aid Program” or “REAP.”


b. The formula for allocating REAP aid shall use the following variables, where:

D = dollar value per point
C = latest population of a municipality using the most recent State population estimates provided by the New Jersey Department of Labor or the U.S. Bureau of the Census, whichever is most recent.
W = weighting factor of fiscal stress
T = total aid
and the formula shall be:  T = P x C x D x W;
or:  Total aid = total number of points times population, times dollar value of a point, times weighting factor.


c. A system of determining variables in the formula for allocating State aid, other than for determining the dollar value of a point, shall be proposed within six months of enactment of this act by the commissioner and director, and shall be adopted by each as rules pursuant to the “Administrative Procedure Act,” P.L.1968, 410 (
C.52:14B-1 et seq.

(1) A schedule of the number of points for each type of service shall be set by the commissioner or director, as appropriate to the local government unit.


(2) The director or the commissioner may assign the amount of points for services that are not included on the schedule on a case-by-case basis.

(4) An increase to the number of points by an amount not to exceed 25% of the number provided to the recipient, to be granted to the provider of regional service.


(5) A formula for weighting points based on a local unit's degree of fiscal stress.


d. The commissioner and the director shall establish procedures for the administration of REAP aid and provide for an application and award process that:

(1) is concurrent with the timetable and process of setting property tax rates;


(2) ensures that regional services are bonafide;


(3) ensures that to qualify for the receipt of REAP aid under 
P.L.1999, c. 61
 (
C.54:4-8.76 et seq.
), regional services result in savings for the cost of services, including any new capital expenditures, reflected as current or future budget reductions, limits on future cost increases, minimizing the costs of a new service, or such other criteria as the commissioner or director may deem relevant;  and


(4) provides for monitoring, oversight, and enforcement of the provisions of REAP.

(4) provides for monitoring, oversight, and enforcement of the provisions of REAP.


e. Each year the director and commissioner shall review applications and calculate the allowable number of points accumulated by the respective local units and calculate the amount of REAP aid each local unit has earned.  The commissioner shall properly allocate aid to ensure that the municipalities constituting sending districts, and regional and consolidated school districts receive their share of aid based on their proportion of taxes or tuition paid, or other appropriate measure.


f. All local unit appropriations for regional services for which REAP aid is provided shall be exempt from the limitations on appropriations pursuant to the provisions of the laws limiting local unit expenditures, P.L.1976, c. 68 (
C.40A:4-45.1 et seq.
), and subsection d. of section 5 of 
P.L.1996, c. 138

AB = (BC + AR Cost + LEP Cost + COMB Cost + SE Census) x GCA
where
BC is the district's or county vocational school district's base cost as calculated pursuant to section 8 of this act;   1
AR Cost is the cost of providing educational and other services for at-risk pupils as calculated pursuant to subsection b. of this section;
LEP Cost is the cost of providing educational and other services for bilingual education pupils as calculated pursuant to subsection c. of this section;

SE Census is the cost of providing programs and services to general special education services pupils and speech-only pupils as calculated pursuant to subsection e. of this section;  and
GCA is geographic cost adjustment.
The GCA shall be the geographic cost adjustment developed by the commissioner and revised by the commissioner every five years in accordance with receipt of census data.


b. AR Cost shall be calculated as follows:
AR Cost = BPA x ARWENR x AR Weight
where
BPA is the base per pupil amount;
ARWENR is the weighted enrollment for at-risk pupils of the school district or county vocational school district, which shall not include combination pupils;  and
AR Weight is the at-risk weight.
For the 2008-2009 through 2010-2011 school years the at-risk weight shall be as follows:
for a district in which the concentration of at-risk pupils is less than 20% of resident enrollment, the at-risk weight shall equal 0.47;
for a district in which the concentration of at-risk pupils is equal to 20% but less than 60% of resident enrollment, the at-risk weight shall equal the district's ((at-risk % - 0.20) x 0.25))+ 0.47;  and
for a district in which the concentration of at-risk pupils is equal to or greater than 60% of resident enrollment, the at-risk weight shall equal 0. 57.

LEP Cost = BPA x LWENR x LEP Weight
where
BPA is the base per pupil amount;
LWENR is the weighted enrollment for the bilingual education pupils of the school district or county vocational school district, which shall not include combination pupils;  and
LEP Weight is the bilingual pupil weight.
For the 2008-2009 through 2010-2011 school years the LEP weight shall be 0.5.  For subsequent school years, the LEP weight shall be established in the Educational Adequacy Report.


d. COMB Cost shall be calculated as follows:
COMB Cost = BPA x CWENR x (AR Weight + COMB Weight)
where
BPA is the base per pupil amount;
CWENR is the weighted enrollment for pupils who are both at-risk and bilingual;
AR Weight is the at-risk weight;  and
COMB Weight is the combination pupil weight.
For the 2008-2009 through 2010-2011 school years the COMB weight shall be 0.125.  For subsequent school years, the COMB weight shall be established in the Educational Adequacy Report.


e. SE Census shall be calculated as follows:
SE Census = (RE x SEACR x AEC x  2/3 ) + (RE x SACR x SEC)
where
RE is the resident enrollment of the school district or county vocational school district;
SEACR is the State average classification rate for general special education services pupils;
AEC is the excess cost for general special education services pupils;
SACR is the State average classification rate for speech-only pupils;  and

New Jersey Statutes Title 40A. Municipalities and Counties 40A § 9-20,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-40a-municipalities-and-counties/nj-st-sect-40a-9-20.html,
New Jersey Statutes Title 18A. Education 18A § 7F-44,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-18a-education/nj-st-sect-18a-7f-44.html,"
a. The Constitution of the State of New Jersey states that the Legislature shall provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of free public schools for the instruction of all children in the State between the ages of five and eighteen years.  (N.J. Const. art. VIII, sec. 4, par.1).


b. The State, in addition to any constitutional mandates, has a moral obligation to ensure that New Jersey's children, wherever they reside, are provided the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed.  Any school funding formula should provide resources in a manner that optimizes the likelihood that children will receive an education that will make them productive members of society.


c. Although the Supreme Court of New Jersey has held that prior school funding statutes did not establish a system of public education that was thorough and efficient as to certain districts, the Court has consistently held that the Legislature has the responsibility to substantively define what constitutes a thorough and efficient system of education responsive to that constitutional requirement.


d. Every child in New Jersey must have an opportunity for an education based on academic standards that satisfy constitutional requirements regardless of where the child resides, and public funds allocated to this purpose must be expended to support schools that are thorough and efficient in delivering those educational standards.  In turn, school districts must be assured the financial support necessary to provide those constitutionally compelled educational standards.  Any school funding formula should provide State aid for every school district based on the characteristics of the student population and up-to-date measures of the individual district's ability to pay.


e. New Jersey's current public school funding formula, established under the provisions of the “Comprehensive Educational Improvement and Financing Act of 1996,” (CEIFA) 
P.L.1996, c. 138
, has not been used to calculate State aid for public schools since the 2001-02 school year.  Any new school funding formula should account for changes in enrollment and other significant developments, providing relief to those districts that have experienced substantial enrollment increases.


f. The decisions in the Abbott cases have resulted in frequent litigation and a fragmented system of funding under which limited resources cannot be distributed equitably to all districts where at-risk children reside, instead dividing the districts sharply into Abbott and non-Abbott categories for funding purposes without regard to a district's particular pupil characteristics and leading to needlessly adversarial relationships among school districts and between districts and the State.


g. In the absence of a clear, unitary, enforceable statutory formula to govern appropriations for education, crucial funding decisions are made annually, in competition for limited State resources with other needs and requirements as part of the annual budget negotiation process, utilizing many different classes and categories of aid, leading to an uncertain, unpredictable, and untenable funding situation for the State and school districts alike.


h. This act represents the culmination of five years of diligent efforts by both the Executive and Legislative branches of State government to develop an equitable and predictable way to distribute State aid that addresses the deficiencies found in past formulas as identified by the Supreme Court.  Working together toward this common goal, the Department of Education and the Legislature engaged nationally recognized experts in education funding and provided significant opportunities for stakeholder involvement and public input to assist in formulating and refining a comprehensive school funding model that has been validated by experts.  The formula accounts for the individual characteristics of school districts and the realities of their surroundings, including the need for additional resources to address the increased disadvantages created by high concentrations of children at-risk.


i. The formula established under this act is the product of a careful and deliberative process that first involved determining the educational inputs necessary to provide a high-quality education, including specifically addressing the supplemental needs of at-risk students and those with limited English proficiency (LEP), and a determination of the actual cost of providing those programs.  The formula provides adequate funding that is realistically geared to the core curriculum content standards, thus linking those standards to the actual funding needed to deliver that content.


j. In recognition of the unique problems and cost disadvantages faced by districts with high concentrations of at-risk students, it is appropriate to reflect in the formula a greater weight as the district's proportion of at-risk students increases.  In addition, the new formula recognizes the disadvantages of an expanded group of students by including in the definition of at-risk those students who qualify for free or reduced-price lunch.  Expanding the definition of at-risk students in this manner will significantly increase the resources flowing to districts with high concentrations of these low-income students.


k. In light of the demonstrable, beneficial results and success of the current Abbott preschool program, it is appropriate to build upon this success by incorporating in the formula an expanded high-quality preschool program for all children who qualify for free and reduced price meals in all districts.  It is appropriate for the formula to acknowledge that at-risk children do not always receive the same educational exposure at an early age as their peers and to provide the additional resources necessary through high-quality preschool to prepare every child to learn and succeed.


l. It is appropriate to reflect in this formula the inherent value of educating a child in the least restrictive environment and, whenever possible, in that child's neighborhood school alongside his peers.  The new funding formula should provide incentives for keeping classified students in district.


m. It is also appropriate to recognize in the formula the need for all schools to incorporate effective security measures, which may vary from district to district depending upon the at-risk student population and other factors, and to provide categorical funding to address these important requirements.


n. In recognition of the potentially wide variability in special education costs, even for the same category of disability, from district to district, it is appropriate for the new funding formula to mitigate the impact of that variability by establishing a census model based on the actual Statewide average excess cost of educating special education students and by providing for an increase in State aid for extraordinary costs incurred by districts.


o. It is imperative that any new school funding formula work in conjunction with the key school accountability measures that have been enacted in recent years to promote greater oversight, transparency, and efficiency in the delivery of educational services.  These accountability measures include the New Jersey Quality Single Accountability Continuum, the “School District Fiscal Accountability Act,” 
P.L.2006, c. 15
 (
C.18A:7A-54 et seq.
), 
P.L.2007, c. 63
 (
C.40A:65-1
 et al.) which established the duties and responsibilities of the executive county superintendent of schools, and 
P.L.2007, c. 53
 (
C.18A:55-3
 et al.).


p. Together with a renewed legislative focus on and commitment to providing sufficient means to maintain and support a high-quality system of free public schools in the State, a new funding formula supported by significantly increased State resources will ensure compliance with all statutory and constitutional mandates.  Districts that were formerly designated as Abbott districts will be provided sufficient resources to continue those Court-identified programs, positions, and services that have proven effective while being provided the flexibility to shift resources and programmatic focus based on the needs of their students and current research.


q. The time has come for the State to resolve the question of the level of funding required to provide a thorough and efficient system of education for all New Jersey school children.  The development and implementation of an equitable and adequate school funding formula will not only ensure that the State's students have access to a constitutional education as defined by the core curriculum content standards, but also may help to reduce property taxes and assist communities in planning to meet their educational expenses.  The development of a predictable, transparent school funding formula is essential for school districts to plan effectively and deliver the quality education that our citizens expect and our Constitution requires.

New Jersey Statutes Title 40. Municipalities and Counties 40 § 37A-104,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-40-municipalities-and-counties/nj-st-sect-40-37a-104.html,
New Jersey Statutes Title 40. Municipalities and Counties 40 § 23-6.38,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-40-municipalities-and-counties/nj-st-sect-40-23-6-38.html,"
(a) There are nearly 700,000 people over the age of 65 in this State, and that these citizens, now numbering almost 10% of the State's population, are of special concern because their numbers are growing faster than the rest of the population and because, increasingly there is no room for them in the labor market.


(b) During the last century life expectancy has been lengthened by 20 years.  Since 1900 the total population of New Jersey has doubled but our senior population has quadrupled.  With the lengthening of life expectancy has come the impact of technology which permits earlier retirement and makes employment opportunities unavailable for much of the older population.


(c) The result of these changes is that many older people are socially isolated and economically deprived.  Lack of preparation for changed family relationships and social situations create crises for which assistance is not readily available.  Many such crises can be averted if the problems of aging are anticipated and made the subject of prior planning.


(d) A central place is needed, therefore, where older citizens facing such situations can turn for assistance through information on community resources.  Those who need such information vary from the middle-aged unemployed to the recent retiree and the helpless aged, from the affluent to the very poor, from the rural citizen to the urban and suburban resident, from the learned to the uneducated.


(e) Efforts to avert crises among this expanding segment of the population must have two major goals;  the development of an understanding of the nature of aging so that people may grow old with dignity and independence;  and, the ready identification and availability of community resources for older people, to whom they are often inaccessible or nonexistent.  These resources need to be identified, expanded and made more immediately available to those who need them.


(f) While the Government of the State of New Jersey has recognized some of its special responsibilities in this area by creating the State Division on Aging, it has become apparent that this agency will function more effectively by providing a means by which it can achieve a closer relationship with the people it seeks to help, and through which it can increase access to desirable programs.


(g) It is apparent, therefore, that channels for the distribution of information on the resources available to older people, should be established throughout the State so as to be conveniently available to all segments of our older population, and that they should be maintained by county governments.

a. As of April 1, 1995, individuals in the State of New Jersey under age 65 who became eligible for Medicare benefits due to a disability or because they suffer from the end stage of renal disease do not have access to Medicare supplement insurance, otherwise known as “Medigap” insurance.


b. Prior to that date only one health insurance carrier in New Jersey offered Medicare supplement insurance contracts to the under 65 population.  Unsustainable losses, caused in part by the fact that this carrier was the only carrier providing such coverage, led to the carrier's withdrawal from the Medicare supplement insurance market for the under 65 population on March 31, 1995.


c. Because Medicare supplement insurance pays for many of the health care expenses not covered by Medicare, the absence of Medicare supplement insurance will eventually leave thousands of blind, AIDS, disabled and dialysis patients in New Jersey without any means of secondary insurance to supplement their Medicare coverage.  For many of these people with serious illnesses, the 20 percent co-payments and deductibles charged by Medicare will cause financial hardship and emotional distress.  If no action is taken, Medicare recipients under 65 years old will be forced to deplete their personal assets and may eventually be forced to resort to Medicaid to supplement their health care needs.


d. Therefore, the Legislature declares that it is in the public interest:

(1) to ensure that Medicare supplement insurance is available to the individuals under 65 years of age who become eligible for Medicare benefits;


(2) to require all health insurance carriers who currently sell Medicare supplement insurance to the over age 65 population to also offer, at a minimum, Medicare Supplement Plan C coverage to the under age 65 population;


(3) to establish a mechanism that will:  allow the premiums on those Medicare supplement insurance policies and contracts to remain affordable;  encourage insurance carriers to continue to serve or enter this market;  and provide for the equitable sharing of any losses;


(4) to ensure that premiums for the more than 200,000 New Jersey residents who have purchased Medicare supplement insurance remain affordable and do not become subject to excessive rate increases;  and


(5) that regulations necessary to effectuate the purposes of this act be promulgated by the Commissioner of Insurance expeditiously due to the urgency of the situation.

f. The shortages of recreational opportunities and sources of fresh fruits and vegetables have contributed to alarming increases in childhood obesity and other adverse health consequences for municipal residents;  and


g. While provisions of statutory law authorize local units to lease or sell property that is not needed for public use in order to further various public purposes, these statutory provisions limit municipalities from enlisting the assistance of nonprofit entities to develop these properties for a range of public purposes that could enhance the recreational, educational, and nutritional needs of local residents;  and


h. Authorization for local units to lease and sell vacant land to nonprofit entities to cultivate these lands can provide both recreational opportunities and a source of fresh, locally grown fruits and vegetables for local residents;  and


i. The nonprofit cultivation of previously vacant land by nonprofit entities is a public purpose for which the long term lease and sale of these properties, and exemption from property taxation therefor, is warranted, even in those instances when produce is sold to further the mission of these nonprofit entities.

b. One group of these individuals is comprised of clients in the State psychiatric hospitals or developmental centers who are developmentally disabled and who exhibit psychiatric or behavioral problems and are known as “dually diagnosed” clients.  The severity of their conditions precludes effective treatment in either developmental centers or State psychiatric hospitals.  For these clients, a more intensive, specialized, behaviorally oriented program is required.


c. The other group of these individuals includes clients of institutions administered by the Division of Mental Health Services who are developmentally disabled, have been administratively or judicially discharged from the Division of Mental Health Services, and who are in need of the services of the Division of Developmental Disabilities.  These clients are known as “discharged pending placement” clients.


d. There exists on the grounds of Ancora Psychiatric Hospital as a pilot program a facility designed to serve the special needs of both the dually diagnosed and discharged pending placement populations that is unfunded for continued operation.

a. The need to offer care services to the growing number of frail elderly and disabled persons in New Jersey and the benefits derived from the provision of these services are well documented;


b. While State government has responded to the home care needs of the State's elderly and disabled population through the Medicaid Community Care Program for the Elderly and Disabled (CCPED), there remains a substantial number of people whose home care needs have not been met;


c. Many of these frail elderly and disabled people in the “no-care” zone are equipped to impoverish themselves to receive services under Medicaid;


d. The limitations on resources that a person may have to participate in the Medicaid program or the Community Care Program for the Elderly and Disabled are so restrictive as to make many of those in need of home care ineligible for needed services;


e. Many people who need care to remain in their homes do not have the funds to pay privately for the services;  and


f. It is therefore necessary to establish a program to extend such services to a greater number of the State's elderly and disabled population.

a. The findings of a recently reported, federally-funded study by Georgetown University, in conjunction with the Rand Corporation and the University of Pennsylvania, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine, indicate that physicians are far less likely to refer blacks and women than white men with identical complaints of chest pain to heart specialists for cardiac catheterization;  and the authors of this study suggest that the difference in referral rates stems from racial and sexual biases;


b. These findings are the latest in a growing body of medical literature which documents race and gender-based disparities in the provision of health care, especially in the treatment of cardiovascular disease;  however, according to the Surgeon General of the United States, the Georgetown University study represents the best attempt to date to document the racial attitudes of physicians as a factor in the poorer health of African Americans;


c. It is estimated that the minority population in the United States will increase by 60% between now and the year 2010;


d. Cultural awareness and cultural competence are essential skills for providing quality health care to a diverse patient population;


e. Only a small percentage of medical schools nationwide currently provide some formal training in cultural competence;


f. The Association of American Medical Colleges is working to help medical schools improve the teaching of cultural competency;  and


g. The public interest in providing quality health care to all segments of society dictates the need for a formal requirement that medical professionals be trained in the provision of culturally competent health care as a condition of licensure to practice medicine in New Jersey.

a. Bedbugs are small insects with flat bodies, antennae and small eyes;  adult bedbugs are oval, wingless and rusty-red in color and are visible to the naked eye, and often hide in cracks and crevices;  in homes, bedbugs are commonly found in areas where people sleep, concentrating in mattresses, box springs, and bed frames;  bedbugs feed primarily on the blood of humans, usually at night when people are sleeping;


b. According to a joint statement issued by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, bedbugs have been common throughout United States history;  although bedbug populations dropped dramatically during the mid-20th century, the United States is one of many countries now experiencing an alarming resurgence in the population of bedbugs, and public health agencies across the country have been overwhelmed by complaints about bedbugs;


c. According to the New Jersey Department of Health, in most cases, bedbugs are transported from infested areas to non-infested areas when they cling onto a person's clothing, or crawl into luggage, furniture, or bedding that is then brought into the home;  if a mattress is contaminated with bedbugs, it is easy for bedbugs to spread to non-contaminated items that are within close proximity;


d. Although bedbugs are not known to transmit disease, they are considered to be an extreme nuisance to the general public and can cause a variety of negative physical and mental health concerns and economic consequences;  and


e. To help curtail widespread infestation of bedbugs, it is necessary to take measures to prevent cross-contamination of bedbugs from used mattresses and box springs to other furniture or bedding.

a. The housing needs of many New Jersey citizens remain unmet each year, exemplified by the fact that, in recent years, only one-half of the estimated annual need for new housing units has been actually constructed.


b. The costs of conventional housing construction, mortgages, land and utilities have increased tremendously in recent years making it increasingly difficult for certain segments of the population, notably the elderly, families with young children, unmarried individuals, and young couples, to afford suitable conventional housing.


c. Due to the conventional housing shortage in New Jersey, the Legislature has a responsibility to encourage alternate means of housing for New Jersey citizens.


d. The design, durability and appearance of manufactured housing has improved significantly over the last decade so that certain styles of manufactured homes are difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish from conventional homes, and yet only 400 of these manufactured homes were sold Statewide during 1982.


e. Despite these significant improvements, there has not been a corresponding rapid escalation in the costs of manufactured homes, with the result that these homes remain affordable for the general population.


f. It is, therefore, in the public interest to promote the use of manufactured homes as affordable housing in New Jersey.

c. To ensure that charity care subsidy payments remain viable and appropriate, the State shall maintain the charity care subsidy at an amount not less than 75% of the Medicaid-priced amounts of charity care provided by hospitals in the State.  In addition, these amounts shall be augmented to reflect payments to hospitals by the Medicaid program for Graduate Medical Education and Indirect Medical Education based on the most recent Graduate Medical Education and Indirect Medical Education formulas utilized by the federal Medicare program.


d. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section to the contrary, in the event that the change from the charity care subsidy formula in effect for fiscal year 2004 to the formula established pursuant to this section in effect for fiscal year 2005, reduces, for any reason, the amount of the charity care subsidy payment to a hospital below the amount that the hospital received under the formula in effect in fiscal year 2004, the hospital shall receive a payment equal to the amount it would have received under the formula in effect for fiscal year 2004.

New Jersey Statutes Title 40. Municipalities and Counties 40 § 54D-2,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-40-municipalities-and-counties/nj-st-sect-40-54d-2.html,"
a. The State of New Jersey contains many unique natural, recreational, and economic resources that are enjoyed not only by the citizens of the State but also by millions of visitors from all over the United States and the world, which in turn results in a multi-billion dollar tourism industry that is crucial to the economic well-being of the State.


b. The provision of appropriate public facilities and improvements necessary to promote and sustain tourism is especially difficult for public entities located in sixth class counties of this State.  In those counties a relatively small permanent population combines with a relative lack of a diversification in the economic base to present special obstacles for public entities which seek to undertake and fund tourism facilities and improvements without damaging the economic prosperity of the locality by imposing onerous taxes on permanent residents or businesses.


c. The creation of tourism improvement and development districts may assist municipalities in those counties in promoting economic growth and employment related to a tourism-economy and that municipalities in counties of the sixth class should be encouraged to create tourism improvement and development districts to finance the acquisition, maintenance, operation and support of convention center facilities and to promote tourism in order to enhance the local tourism business climates.


d. It is in the public interest to encourage these municipalities in counties of the sixth class to seek regional solutions to common problems related to economic prosperity of this State, and to enhance the prosperity of those municipalities by the adoption of appropriate ordinances to assess, levy and collect taxes upon receipts from certain sales and services, and to impose certain municipal fees.  These special public finance measures which are not generally available to other local units of the State, are appropriate to address the particular economic conditions of sixth class counties, and are not necessary or appropriate in areas with a larger population base and more diversified economic structure, which are not so heavily affected by the seasonal fluctuations of a tourism based economy.



e. The extension of the tourism development fees provided by the amendatory and supplementary act, 
P.L.2002, c. 72
 is intended to serve as a tool for the tourism improvement and development authority to attract visitors and tourists to the State.  The municipalities that constitute the tourism improvement and development district will establish the amounts of the fees, in their sole discretion, with no fee schedule set by the State.

 for school pupils or to improve pedestrian safety.
For the purposes of this subsection, (1) “population” means the official population count as reported by the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development;  and (2) “municipal road mileage” means that road mileage under the jurisdiction of municipalities, as determined by the department.


d. There shall be appropriated at least $175,000,000 for each fiscal year commencing July 1, 2006 through the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2015, and $400,000,000 for each fiscal year commencing July 1, 2016 and for each fiscal year thereafter, for the purposes provided herein and in subsections b., c. , e., f., and g. of this section.  (1) Of that appropriation, the commissioner shall allocate 37.5 percent of the total appropriation as State aid for municipalities pursuant to the provisions of subsection c. of this section, provided that $5,000,000 for each fiscal year commencing July 1, 2006 through the fiscal year commencing July 1, 2015, and $10,000,000 for each fiscal year commencing July 1, 2016 and for each fiscal year thereafter of the amount allocated as State aid for municipalities shall be set aside and sub-allocated as State aid to any municipality qualifying for aid pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1978, c. 14 (
C.52:27D-178 et seq.
).  The commissioner shall allocate the aid to each municipality in the same proportion that the municipality receives aid under P.L.1978, c. 14 (
C.52:27D-178 et seq.
).  (2)   The commissioner shall allocate 37.5 percent of the total appropriation pursuant to the provisions of subsection e. of this section for the Local County Aid Program.  (3) The commissioner shall allocate seven percent of the total appropriation pursuant to the provisions of subsection b. of this section for the “Local Aid Infrastructure Fund.”  (4) The commissioner shall allocate seven percent of the appropriation pursuant to the provisions of subsection f. of this section for the “Local Freight Impact Fund.”  (5) The remaining 11 percent of the appropriation shall be allocated pursuant to the provisions of subsection g. of this section for the “Local Bridges Fund.”


e. The commissioner may, pursuant to appropriations or authorizations being made from time to time by the Legislature according to law, allocate additional funding to the Local County Aid Program for public highway projects, in accordance with a formula similar to that provided for in subsection c. of this section, except that Cm equals road mileage under county jurisdiction and Sm equals total county road mileage within the State.



f. The commissioner shall, pursuant to appropriations or authorizations being made from time to time by the Legislature according to law, allocate at the commissioner's discretion, State aid to counties and municipalities for transportation projects that address the impacts of freight travel in local communities and on local transportation infrastructure, except that the amount to be appropriated for this program shall be seven percent of the total amount appropriated pursuant to subsection d. of this section.  This State aid shall be set aside prior to any formula allocations provided for in subsections c., d., e., and g. of this section, and shall be known as the “Local Freight Impact Fund.”

a. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, elderly Americans are disproportionately likely to die by suicide;  individuals 65 years of age and older comprise only 13% of the United States population, but they accounted for 18% of all suicide deaths in 2000;


b. In New Jersey, individuals 65 years of age and older also comprise about 13% of the State population and they accounted for 17% of all suicide deaths in the State in 2000;


c. The national suicide rate for men is relatively constant from 25 to 64 years of age, but increases significantly after 65 years of age, with men accounting for 84% of suicides among individuals 65 years of age and older in 2000;  and for women the national suicide rate peaks between 45 and 64 years of age and does so again after 75 years of age;


d. When categorized by race and gender, white men 85 years of age and older have among the highest suicide rates nationally, with 59 deaths per 100,000 persons in 2000, which is more than five times the national rate of 10.6 per 100,000, and according to “Healthy New Jersey 2010,” issued by the Department of Health and Senior Services, the seventh leading cause of premature death among New Jerseyans is suicide, with the highest rates among elderly white males;


e. The risk factors for suicide among elderly Americans differ from those among younger groups;  elderly persons have a higher prevalence of depression, greater use of highly lethal methods and greater social isolation;


f. The presence of mental illness (especially depression and alcohol abuse), the presence of physical illness or impairment, unrelieved pain, financial stress and social isolation (especially being widowed in males) and the availability of firearms in the home contribute to the higher incidence of suicide among elderly Americans;


g. Suicide among elderly Americans may even be underreported by 40% or more;  omitted from statistics are “silent suicides,” such as deaths from noncompliance with medical instructions, prescription overdosages, self-starvation or dehydration and other self-induced “accidents”;


h. Most elderly patients who complete suicide saw their physicians within a few months of their deaths and more than a third did so within the week of their suicide, and warning signs which indicate a serious risk of suicide include:  loss of interest in things or activities that are usually seen as enjoyable;  lessening of social interactions, self-care and grooming;  violating medical regimens or prescription dosages;  experiencing or expecting loss of a spouse;  feeling hopeless or worthless;  and putting personal affairs in order, including giving things away or making changes to a will;  and


i. Physicians, nurses and other health care professionals who treat and care for elderly patients need to be aware of the higher incidence of suicide among elderly Americans and recognize the risk factors associated with this age group.

a. The public safety requires reform of the juvenile justice system;


b. Juvenile arrests for murder, robbery, aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault and aggravated assault have increased 38 percent between 1988 and 1993 and New Jersey ranks near the top nationally in the number of juvenile arrests for serious violent crimes;


c. Juvenile crime has become a leading cause of injury and death among young people;


d. Currently, preventive, deterrent and rehabilitative services and sanctions for juveniles are the responsibility of no less than three State departments:  The Department of Law and Public Safety deals with county prosecutors and local police and implements prevention programs;  the Department of Corrections operates the New Jersey Training School for Boys and the Juvenile Medium Security Facility, and its Bureau of Parole supervises juvenile parolees;  and the Department of Human Services operates residential and day programs in facilities for juveniles adjudicated delinquent;


e. The division of responsibility for the juvenile justice population and the limitations on resources available to meet ever-increasing demands for services provided by the Departments of Human Services and Corrections have prevented the departments from maximizing efforts to meet the special needs of the juvenile justice population;


f. The juvenile justice system lacks services and sanctions short of incarceration, particularly in urban areas and for that reason, many juveniles are not held accountable until they have committed a series of increasingly serious criminal acts;


g. The special needs of juveniles can be addressed through services and sanctions provided at the county and local level;


h. The need to protect the public from criminal acts by juvenile offenders requires a comprehensive program and concerted action of governmental agencies and private organizations at the State, county and local level that permit effective response and avoid waste of scarce resources;



i. (1) The comprehensive program should provide a range of services and sanctions for juveniles sufficient to protect the public through prevention;  early intervention;  and a range of meaningful sanctions that ensure accountability, provide training, education, treatment and, when necessary, confinement followed by community supervision that is adequate to protect the public and promote successful reintegration into the community;



(2) Consistent with the need to protect the public, services and sanctions for juveniles shall provide balanced attention to the protection of the community, the imposition of accountability for offenses committed, fostering interaction and dialogue between the offender, victim and community and the development of competencies to enable juvenile offenders to become responsible and productive members of the community.

(2) Consistent with the need to protect the public, services and sanctions for juveniles shall provide balanced attention to the protection of the community, the imposition of accountability for offenses committed, fostering interaction and dialogue between the offender, victim and community and the development of competencies to enable juvenile offenders to become responsible and productive members of the community.



j. The most efficient and effective use of available resources requires fixing responsibility for the comprehensive program in a single State agency and providing incentives to encourage the development and provision of appropriate services and sanctions at the county and local level;  and


k. It is, therefore, necessary to establish a Juvenile Justice Commission responsible for operating State services and sanctions for juveniles involved in the juvenile justice system and responsible for developing a Statewide plan for effective provision of juvenile justice services and sanctions at the State, county and local level;  to establish a State/Community Partnership Grant Program through which the State will provide incentives to county and local governments to encourage the provision of services and sanctions for juveniles adjudicated or charged as delinquent and programs for the prevention of juvenile delinquency, and to establish county youth services commissions responsible for planning and implementing the Partnership at the local level.

a. Many New Jersey administrative departments and agencies, including, but not limited to, the Departments of Health, Human Services, Community Affairs, Corrections, and Agriculture, currently create, maintain, receive, and transmit individually identifiable data and aggregated data sets in order to perform necessary and vital administrative functions delegated to the agencies.


b. The creation of a process by which a State or federal administrative department or agency or an authorized researcher can access data and data sets created or maintained by a federal, State, or local administrative department or agency will help facilitate the development and evaluation of this data, reduce duplicative data collection and maintenance efforts, and allow for comparison of data for accuracy and reliability.


c. The linkage of multiple sources of State, federal, and local data and the application of valid statistical techniques can facilitate the identification of population trends and individual and community-level determinants directly related to the health, safety, security, and well-being of New Jersey residents.


d. The establishment of a secure, Statewide, integrated Population Health Data Project (“iPHD Project)” containing certain data collected by New Jersey administrative departments and agencies, that includes data related to health and publicly supported programs that will facilitate approved, project-by-project analysis and research and the development of the most effective means for improving the health, safety, security, and well-being of New Jersey residents and the overall cost-efficiency of government programs.


e. The Medicaid Accountable Care Organization Demonstration Project established pursuant to 
P.L.2011, c. 114
 (
C.30:4D-8.1 et seq.
) requires the Rutgers Center for State Health Policy to analyze patient data received from the Department of Human Services and from certified Medicaid Accountable Care Organizations in order to evaluate the achievement of the health care quality improvement and cost containment goals of the Demonstration Project, and the Rutgers Center for State Health Policy currently has the technological and operational resources required to receive, maintain, and transmit individually identifiable data and data sets in a secure database.


f. The Rutgers Center for State Health Policy is responsible for evaluating New Jersey's Comprehensive Medicaid Waiver Demonstration Project with funding from the New Jersey Department of Human Services and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, whereby it receives comprehensive Medicaid enrollment data, fee-for-service claims data, and managed care encounter data, and conducts analyses of Medicaid claims and encounter data to inform recommendations to improve care and reduce costs for the top one percent of Medicaid beneficiaries who account for a disproportionate share of program spending.

a. The commission shall foster and coordinate workforce investment initiatives of all State Departments.  It shall promote initiatives of the Department of Education and the Commission on Higher Education to maximize the contributions of the State's public schools and institutions of higher education in implementing the State workforce investment policy developed by the commission.  The commission shall foster and coordinate initiatives of the Department of Education and the Commission on Higher Education that will enhance the State's efforts to assist at-risk youths in achieving educational success and making successful transitions to work.  The commission shall foster initiatives of the Commission on Higher Education among institutions of higher education that will enhance the State's workforce investment efforts, including:  the coordination of vocational programs between institutions;  more use of facilities at institutions which provide education at or above the level of county colleges, including, but not limited to, the Advanced Technology Centers established pursuant to P.L.1985, c. 102 (

);  developing more programs to offer four year degrees for working students who attend only at nights and on weekends;  and expanding programs which provide college credit for training and educational experiences outside of traditional academic contexts.


b. The commission shall have the responsibility, jointly with the Department of Education, the Department of Labor and Workforce Development and the Commission on Higher Education, to:  (1) establish standards regarding the minimum levels of remedial instruction which shall be made available to a trainee under any workforce investment program, including any program of training undertaken in connection with additional unemployment compensation benefits provided pursuant to the provisions of 
P.L.1992, c. 47

New Jersey Statutes Title 30. Institutions and Agencies 30 § 1AA-1.1,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-30-institutions-and-agencies/nj-st-sect-30-1aa-1-1.html,"
a. Disability is a natural part of the human experience that does not diminish the right of individuals with developmental disabilities to live independently, exert control and choice over their own lives, and fully participate in and contribute to their communities through full integration and inclusion in the economic, political, social, cultural and educational mainstream of United States society;


b. Recent studies indicate that individuals with developmental disabilities comprise between 1.2 and 1.65% of the United States population, and individuals whose disabilities occur during their developmental period frequently have severe disabilities that are likely to continue indefinitely;


c. Individuals with developmental disabilities often encounter discrimination in the provision of critical services and are at greater risk than the general population of abuse, neglect, financial and sexual exploitation, and the violation of their legal and human rights;


d. A substantial portion of individuals with developmental disabilities and their families do not have access to appropriate support and services, including access to assistive technology, from generic and specialized service systems, and remain unserved or underserved;


e. Individuals with developmental disabilities often require lifelong community services, individualized supports and other forms of assistance that are most effective when provided in a coordinated manner;


f. There is a need to ensure that services, supports and other assistance are provided in a culturally competent manner, which ensures that individuals from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds are fully included in all activities provided under 
P.L.2003, c.54
 (
C.30:1AA-1.1
 et al.);


g. Family members, friends and members of the community can play an important role in enhancing the lives of individuals with developmental disabilities, especially when the family members, friends and community members are provided with the necessary community services, individualized supports and other forms of assistance;


h. Current research indicates that 88% of individuals with developmental disabilities live with their families or in their own households, and many service delivery systems and communities are not prepared to meet the impending needs of the adults with developmental disabilities who are living at home with parents who are 60 years of age or older and serve as the primary caregivers of these adults;


i. Individuals with developmental disabilities are waiting for appropriate services in their communities, and the public needs increased awareness of the capabilities and competencies of individuals with developmental disabilities, particularly in cases in which the individuals are provided with necessary services, supports and other assistance;


j. As increasing numbers of individuals with developmental disabilities are living, learning, working and participating in all aspects of community life, there is an increasing need for a well trained workforce that is able to provide the services, supports and other forms of direct assistance that are required to enable the individuals to carry out those activities;


k. There needs to be greater effort to recruit individuals from minority backgrounds into professions serving individuals with developmental disabilities and their families;


l. The goals of the State properly include providing individuals with developmental disabilities with the information, skills, opportunities and support to:  make informed choices and decisions about their lives;  live in homes and communities in which these individuals can exercise their full rights and responsibilities as citizens;  pursue meaningful and productive lives;  contribute to their families, communities, the State and the nation;  have interdependent friendships and relationships with other persons;  live free of abuse, neglect, financial and sexual exploitation, and violations of their legal and human rights;  and achieve full integration and inclusion in society, in an individualized manner, consistent with the unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities and capabilities of each individual;


m. As the nation, states and communities maintain and expand community living options for individuals with developmental disabilities, there is a need to evaluate the access to those options by individuals with developmental disabilities and the effects of those options on those individuals;  and


n. Therefore, the purpose of this act is to assure that individuals with developmental disabilities and their families participate in the design of, and have access to, needed community services, individualized supports and other forms of assistance which promote self-determination, independence, productivity, and integration and inclusion in all facets of community life, through culturally competent advocacy, capacity-building and systemic-change activities conducted by the State Council on Developmental Disabilities, as required by the “Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000,” 
Pub.L.106-402
, 
42 U.S.C. s.15001 et seq.
  These activities shall:

(1) be consistent with the purpose described in this subsection and the public policy described in section 2 of 
P.L.2003, c.54
 (
C.30:1AA-1.2
);  and


(2) contribute to a coordinated, consumer-and family-centered and consumer-and family-directed comprehensive system which includes needed community services, individualized supports and other forms of assistance that promote self-determination for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.

A. To serve as a fact-co-ordinating body and to develop the means and procedure by which the general plans and policies proposed for the development of the region may be carried out;


B. To sponsor the carrying out of properly developed plans which result from surveys and research concerning population, land and water resources and uses, and other related subjects;


C. To co-ordinate the activities of the Commission and Committees on Interstate Co-operation and their joint agency, the Council of State Governments, with the work of the appropriate State and Federal agencies for the prevention and abatement of pollution.


D. To encourage interstate compacts and the enactment of uniform State laws for the abatement of water pollution, for flood control and for the proper general use and control of the waters of the Delaware river.


E. To advance, perpetuate, and outline the work recommended by its conferences, and to develop and propose new objectives;  and
WHEREAS, It is the purpose of the Commissions (or Committees) on Interstate Co-operation of said four States, acting through said Interstate Commission on the Delaware river basin, to eliminate confusion and conflict among said States by the promotion and enactment of uniform laws in said States to preserve in a safe and sanitary condition the waters and watershed of said Delaware river basin and to provide uniform concurrent regulations for the control and the enforcement of the elimination of pollution in the waters thereof in said States, respectively;  and
WHEREAS, Said Interstate Commission on the Delaware river basin, in co-operation with the State health departments of said States, respectively, and the National Resources Committee and the Public Health Service of the Federal Government has made a study, for the purposes above recited of said Delaware river and its tributaries in said Delaware river basin, and has formulated proposals for the inter-governmental co-operation of said States in the correction and control of pollution of the waters thereof, which have been formally approved, ratified and accepted by the health departments of said States, the United States Health Service and the said National Resources Committee, respectively, in the following form:
WHEREAS, A substantial part of the territory of the States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware is situated within the Delaware river drainage basin;  and
WHEREAS, The increase in the population of the various municipal areas situated within the Delaware river basin, and the growth of industrial activity within the basin, have resulted in increasingly serious pollution of the waters of the Interstate Delaware river and its tributaries;  and
WHEREAS, Such pollution constitutes a grave menace to the health, welfare, and recreational facilities of the people living in the Delaware river basin, and occasions great economic loss;  and
WHEREAS, The control of future pollution and the correction of existing pollution of the waters of the interstate Delaware river and its tributaries is of prime importance to the people living in the Delaware river basin and can best be accomplished through the co-operation of the representatives of the people in the basin, in the States of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware;
Now, therefore, the State of New York and the State of New Jersey and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the State of Delaware agree and are bound as follows:

a. It has been more than twenty years since the Legislature enacted the “Fair Housing Act,” P.L.1985, c. 222 (
C.52:27D-301
 et al.) which provides a voluntary system for municipalities to follow in zoning for affordable housing.  Since the time of the enactment of this law, there has not been a unified review by the Legislature of the administration of the “ Fair Housing Act,” or a review of the issue of housing availability and affordability in general.


b. Soaring housing prices, escalating property taxes, increasing municipal fees, rising energy costs, and the costs to implement various State rules and regulations have put housing out of the reach of many citizens, particularly senior citizens on fixed incomes.


c. Available land to develop is rapidly dwindling, causing many experts to predict that New Jersey will be “built-out” by the end of the next decade.  New Jersey currently is the most densely populated State in the nation.


d. Conflicting public policies on land use and planning have resulted in a lack of a coordinated approach by the State in addressing the issues that relate to the availability of decent, affordable housing for both home buyers and renters.


e. There is a need for continued, integrated oversight by the Legislature to review and shape solutions to address the State's residents' housing needs, and to address the Legislature's responsibility for the “Fair Housing Act” as an alternative to the court's remedies granted under the Mount Laurel doctrine.

a. Hispanics in New Jersey represent 9% of the total population and constitute the second largest and fastest growing minority in the State.


b. In 1985, 32% of all Hispanic families were headed by women;  43% of whom were families in poverty.


c. Hispanic women are concentrated in low-skill, low-salary jobs, working fewer hours per year and earning less than either black or white women;  their disadvantaged employment status is linked to the fact that Hispanic women have completed fewer years of education than non-Hispanic women;  only 6% have completed college and a mere 43% of Hispanic women as compared to 69% of non-Hispanic women have graduated from high school.


d. Contributing to the Hispanic women's plight is the fact that cultural differences and language barriers are not acknowledged by the present educational, career and social services system in New Jersey;  although some agencies have bilingual staff, they lack the bicultural knowledge of the socioeconomic obstacles that affect an Hispanic woman's ability to fully participate in the programs currently offered.

a. The Dismal Swamp Conservation Area in Middlesex County is approximately 660 acres of freshwater wetlands, forested uplands, and meadows in a densely populated, highly developed central part of the State, offering unique natural habitat including federal priority wetlands;


b. The Dismal Swamp Conservation Area is a birding oasis in a densely developed region of the State where over 175 different bird species have been spotted including the threatened and endangered grasshopper sparrow and yellow-crowned night-heron;


c. In addition, over 175 bird species, 25 mammals and over a dozen reptile and amphibian species have been sighted in the Dismal Swamp Conservation Area;


d. Archeological digs in the Dismal Swamp Conservation Area have uncovered at least five significant archeological sites, including one at least 10,000 years old;


e. This area, spanning Edison Township, Metuchen Borough, and South Plainfield Borough in Middlesex County, represents one of the last remaining wetland ecosystems in a highly urbanized environment in the State;


f. The area consists of privately and publicly owned parcels of land within three municipalities, each with its own planning and zoning authority, and as a result, decisions concerning development within the area are made without a coherent plan;  and


g. It is therefore appropriate and in the best interests of the State to encourage the local governing bodies of Edison Township, Metuchen Borough, and South Plainfield Borough, respectively, in Middlesex County to establish a Dismal Swamp Preservation Commission to provide comprehensive regulatory authority and regional planning for the area with a primary focus on protecting and preserving the ecological, historical, and recreational values of the area.

c. New Jersey ranks fiftieth in the nation for participation in the School Breakfast Program by schools offering school lunch, and has seen only modest increases in participation in recent years;


d. Research shows that school breakfast increases attendance and decreases tardiness, improves academic performance both in class and on standardized tests, improves attentiveness, and reduces emotional and behavioral problems among students from all backgrounds;  and


e. Therefore, it is clearly in the public interest for the State to require that school districts with large populations of students eligible for federally subsidized meals offer the School Breakfast Program and publicize the program in their communities.

a. Changing economic conditions and the current state of financial markets have curtailed the amount of capital available, upon terms tolerable and practicable to developers, for the development of land and construction of housing.


b. The factors that have led to these conditions--such as changes in federal government supervision of institutional lenders, increased reserve requirements imposed on financial institutions, and other structural changes in financial markets--will continue to affect the home-building industry for the foreseeable future.


c. The depressed state of this industry exerts a significant adverse impact on the national economy, particularly severe in this densely populated and highly industrialized State, by curtailing employment opportunities and depressing accustomed standards of living.


d. The distresses of the economy have fallen with exceptional severity upon the housing supply for home-seekers at all economic levels, and most particularly for those of mid-level and modest incomes.


e. Significant alleviation of the current economic situation requires cooperation between public and private institutions, which can be effectively fostered by a State program directed towards meeting short-term capital requirements.


f. The most logical State agency to administer such assistance is the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (HMFA), with its many years of successful experience in actively but prudently financing a variety of housing initiatives.


g. It is, accordingly, the intention of this act to establish, under the administration of the HMFA, a program that will stimulate the housing industry in this State by making available, in adequate volume and on reasonable terms, construction loan guarantees that will enable builders to initiate development of housing of all types and for persons of all income levels in this State.

2. The party States find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the Nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations.  Variations from State to State in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other States.  As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems.  Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their States of origin, can increase the available educational resources.  Participation in this compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.

a. Health care facility-associated infections constitute a major public health problem in this country, affecting from 5% to 10% of hospitalized patients annually, resulting in an estimated two million infections, and 90,000 deaths, and adding an estimated $4.5 to $5.7 billion in health care costs;


b. Many health care facility-associated infections can be prevented, and a goal of zero health care facility-associated infections is desirable.  There are many simple and effective practices in hospitals that can dramatically reduce the incidence of health care facility-associated infections, such as hand washing, using gloves and properly sterilized equipment, and following the same established best practices, every time, for procedures such as the insertion of an intravenous tube to deliver fluids and medication;


c. The uniform reporting of health care facility-associated infections to the State, and the review and analysis of this data by the Department of Health , will provide a measurable means to assist hospitals in improving patient outcomes;


d. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that states establishing public reporting systems for health care facility-associated infections focus on major site categories to report rates of health care facility-associated infections related to procedures and conditions including, but not limited to, urinary tract infections, surgical site infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and central line-related bloodstream infections.  A focus on major site categories helps ensure that data collection is concentrated in populations where health care facility-associated infections are more prevalent, and that the infection rates reported are most useful for targeting prevention practices and making comparisons among hospitals and within hospitals, over time;


e. The Department of Health  currently provides comparative hospital performance data in its annual New Jersey Hospital Performance Report, and including information about hospital infection rates will further enhance the value of the report to the public and health care providers;  and


f. Therefore, it is a matter of public health and fiscal policy that patients in New Jersey's hospitals receive health care that incorporates best practices in infection control, not only to protect their health and lives, but also to ensure the economic viability of New Jersey's hospitals.

a. According to the New Jersey Department of Health, 630,000 children under the age of six are at risk of lead poisoning in New Jersey and should be screened for elevated blood lead levels.  Of this number, the Department of Health estimates that 177,000 pre-school children are at particularly high risk of lead poisoning;


b. Approximately 70,000 pre-school children, or almost 10percent of the population of children under age six, are currently screened for lead poisoning;


c. Screening is an essential element in the fight to reduce and eventually eliminate childhood lead poisoning, and identification of children in the early stages of lead exposure can prevent children from suffering severe cases of lead poisoning;


d. There is no safe level of lead exposure in children, and even low levels of lead in the bloodstream have been shown to affect IQ, attention span, and academic achievement, in a manner that cannot be corrected;



e. Although lead can be found in many sources, lead exposure is entirely preventable, and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes that the best way to address the problem of lead poisoning is to take action to prevent children from coming into contact with lead, while providing appropriate treatment and case management to those children who are found to have elevated blood lead levels;



f. A universal lead screening program will identify which children require medical evaluation and treatment, and will alert parents about the need to identify and abate lead hazards in their homes;


g. The integration of educational and community outreach programs, as part of a universal lead screening program, will raise public consciousness about the insidious dangers of childhood lead poisoning,  encourage parents to take preventive steps to make their homes lead-safe, and encourage communities to strengthen lead exposure prevention programs;  and


h. Universal lead screening and  universal reporting of lead test results will allow the Department of Health and local boards of health to obtain information on  neighborhoods and communities that are at a high risk for lead exposure, and thereby allow for the implementation of targeted lead hazard reduction programs in the areas of greatest need.

a. For over three decades, the State of New Jersey has supported organ and tissue donation as a public policy, because one individual can save up to eight lives by donating his or her vital organs and enhance more than 50 lives by donating tissue;


b. Although 95% of the national population indicates support for donation, a far smaller percentage have actually made a legally binding decision to be organ and tissue donors, the result of which has been the deaths of over 74,186 people nationally and 2,470 New Jersey residents since 1997 because life-saving organs were not available to them for transplant;


c. A public policy supporting organ donation is no longer adequate, given the health crisis faced by more than 98,000 people awaiting life saving organ transplants nationally, of whom more than 4,000 are New Jersey residents;


d. A new public policy of advocacy which encourages positive donation decisions is now imperative in order to save more lives;


e. The health and welfare of New Jersey's residents requires a more dynamic, comprehensive framework regarding organ donation, one with mandated educational and decisional components;


f. This comprehensive framework must incorporate the federal government's charge to organ procurement organizations to work with states in educating the public so that more individuals make positive donation decisions and document those decisions;


g. In order to insure that more New Jersey residents become donors, it is necessary to provide curriculum in both secondary schools and institutions of higher education, as well as establish educational requirements for physicians and nurses, to dispel myths associated with organ donation, provide accurate information about the donation and recovery process, and emphasize the fundamental responsibility of individuals to take appropriate action, when able to do so, to help save another person's life;


h. It is further necessary to provide residents with an accessible, secure means using the Internet, to register as organ donors in a way that ties the donation decision to a routine but necessary function, such as the receipt of a driver's license or personal identification card, so that an interaction on the issue of organ donation occurs at or around the time New Jersey residents reach the age of majority;  and


i. The combined initiatives provided for in this act will effectively achieve the State's public policy goal to increase the number of organ and tissue donors in the State so that more lives can be saved or enhanced.

New Jersey Statutes Title 18A. Education 18A § 7G-2,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-18a-education/nj-st-sect-18a-7g-2.html,"
a. The Constitution of the State of New Jersey requires the Legislature to provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of free public schools and this legislative responsibility includes ensuring that students are educated in physical facilities that are safe, healthy, and conducive to learning.


b. Inadequacies in the quality, utility, and safety of educational facilities have arisen among local school districts of this State.  In order to ensure that the Legislature's constitutional responsibility for adequate educational facilities is met, there is a need to establish an efficiency standard for educational facilities at the elementary, middle, and secondary school levels which will assure that the core curriculum content standards are taught to all of the children of the State in a setting which facilitates and promotes that learning.


c. Educational infrastructure inadequacies are greatest in theSDA districts where maintenance has been deferred and new construction has not been initiated due to concerns about cost.  To remedy the facilities inadequacies of the SDA districts, the State must promptly engage in a facilities needs assessment and fund the entire cost of repairing, renovating, and constructing the new school facilities determined by the Commissioner of Education to be required to meet the school facilities efficiency standards in the SDA districts.  In other districts, the State must also identify need in view of anticipated growth in school population, and must contribute to the cost of the renovation and construction of new facilities to ensure the provision of a thorough and efficient education in those districts.


d. While providing that the educational infrastructure meets the requirements of a thorough and efficient education, the State must also protect the interests of taxpayers who will bear the burden of this obligation.  Design of school facilities should incorporate maximum operating efficiencies and new technologies to advance the energy efficiency of school facilities and the efficiency of other school building systems, construction should be achieved in as efficient a manner as possible, and a mechanism to assure proper maintenance of new facilities should be established and implemented, in order to reduce the overall cost of the program and to preserve this infrastructure investment.

a. Changing economic conditions and financial markets have reduced the availability in the private sector of feasible construction and permanent financing for (1) the construction of new housing, (2) the conversion of non-residential structures to housing, (3) the rehabilitation and improvement of existing housing and (4) the transfer of existing housing among owners;  and these conditions pertain to both rental housing and owner-occupied housing;


b. The foregoing conditions adversely affect the economy of this State and reduce the number of opportunities for adequate and affordable housing in the State that are available to New Jersey residents;


c. Since their creation the New Jersey Mortgage Finance Agency and the New Jersey Housing Finance Agency have contributed significantly to the achievement of the housing goals of New Jersey, providing over 30,000 units of affordable rental housing, and nearly 30,000 loans for home ownership, as well as numerous loans for home improvement;


d. The continued contribution of these two agencies depends on the adaptation of their powers to changing federal housing programs and policies, financing availability for housing and the housing needs of New Jersey residents;  and


e. The combination and enhancement of the powers of the two agencies with respect to the full range of housing types would achieve an economy of scale and better equip the State to deal with the changing housing needs of an increasingly diverse population and economy.
The Legislature therefore declares that it is in the best interests of the residents of New Jersey to create a strong, unified advocate for housing production, finance and improvement which will combine available talent, resources and experience to:

(1) Assure the availability for both rental housing and owner-occupied housing of feasible construction and permanent financing for new housing construction, the conversion of non-residential structures to housing, the rehabilitation and improvement of existing housing, and the transfer of existing housing among owners;


(2) Stimulate the construction, rehabilitation and improvement of adequate and affordable housing in the State so as to increase the number of opportunities for adequate and affordable housing in the State for New Jersey residents, including particularly New Jersey residents of low and moderate income;


(3) Enhance the productive capacity of the private sector in meeting the housing needs of the residents of the State;


(4) Assist in the revitalization of the State's urban areas;  and


(5) Respond to changing housing demographic and economic circumstances by the development of innovative and flexible finance vehicles.

Therefore, this act provides for the consolidation of the New Jersey Housing Finance Agency and the New Jersey Mortgage Finance Agency into an agency to be known as the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency.


(1) Assure the availability for both rental housing and owner-occupied housing of feasible construction and permanent financing for new housing construction, the conversion of non-residential structures to housing, the rehabilitation and improvement of existing housing, and the transfer of existing housing among owners;


(2) Stimulate the construction, rehabilitation and improvement of adequate and affordable housing in the State so as to increase the number of opportunities for adequate and affordable housing in the State for New Jersey residents, including particularly New Jersey residents of low and moderate income;


(3) Enhance the productive capacity of the private sector in meeting the housing needs of the residents of the State;


(4) Assist in the revitalization of the State's urban areas;  and

b. Producers who are exclusive representatives of a company which is a servicing carrier shall be assigned to that carrier for the servicing of association policies.  Producers who are not exclusive representatives of a servicing carrier may, at the election of the producer and with the consent of the servicing carrier, contract with the association to do business through any servicing carrier.  Producers who are not exclusive representatives of a company which is a servicing carrier, or who have not otherwise established a contractual relationship with a servicing carrier pursuant to this section, shall be assigned to all servicing carriers on an equitable basis by the association, pursuant to the plan of operation.  The assignments shall be in proportion to the percentage of association business which each servicing carrier has contracted with the association to accept and shall be balanced among territories.  The assignments shall be reviewed at least annually and upon the request of a servicing carrier or producer.  Pursuant to the plan of operation, the assignments shall be reallocated if it is found that the allocations are demonstrably inequitable.  Reallocations shall be made in a manner to minimize the shifting of producers.


c. Every producer shall be assigned two alternate servicing carriers, pursuant to the plan of operation.  In the event that any servicing carrier normally assigned to any producer ceases, as may be provided in the plan of operation, to accept applications temporarily, such applications shall be redistributed by the association to each producer’s alternate servicing carrier.


d. In order to minimize disruption of association operations in cases in which a servicing carrier withdraws or will be withdrawing from the service of association business, the association, with the approval of the commissioner, shall be authorized to reallocate all, or any part, of the withdrawing servicing carrier’s producers to one or more of the remaining servicing carriers.

b. For the purposes of this section:

New Jersey Statutes Title 55. Tenement Houses and Public Housing 55 § 14K-65,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-55-tenement-houses-and-public-housing/nj-st-sect-55-14k-65.html,"
a. The present depressed condition of the housing industry in this State is both an obstacle to economic recovery and a source of distress to those among our population for whom housing at affordable cost has become inadequate, insufficient or unavailable.


b. By enactment of 
P.L.1992, c. 114
 (
C.55:14K-45 et seq.
) this Legislature recognized the severity of this problem and endeavored to provide a stimulus to the housing industry through a program of loans and loan guarantees for housing development, to be administered by the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (HMFA).


c. The aforesaid enactment, however, is limited to the encouragement of housing that is to be developed for sale to individual home owners;  whereas for the foreseeable future the most pressing need for housing will be among those lower-income groups for whom home ownership remains out of reach, and to whom it is essential that affordable rental housing of a decent standard of habitability be made available.


d. The Assembly Task Force on HMFA Operations, which issued its general recommendations on January 27, 1993, recommended that additional resources be allocated towards significantly increasing rental housing production.


e. The Assembly Housing Committee, in both the 1992-1993 and 1994-1995 legislative sessions, has provided forums on numerous occasions to the banking industry, HMFA, and builders of rental housing, which enabled these parties to formulate a plan to remove the barriers to the construction of affordable rental housing.


f. It is, therefore, the intention of this act to make available, under administration of the HMFA, loan guarantees to developers of rental housing upon terms that include assurances of long-term affordability to low and moderate income renters of a significant proportion of the dwelling units thus developed.


g. It is the further intention of this act to suggest that a portion of the funding provided to the New Jersey Economic Development Authority (NJEDA) under the “Economic Recovery Act,” 
P.L.1992, c. 16
 (
C.34:1B-7.10
 et al.), be directed to the development of affordable rental housing.

a. Intoxication treatment centers, which centers shall render emergency medical care, including detoxification, shall be open 24 hours every day, and shall be located conveniently near population centers.  Services shall be provided for the immediate physical and social needs, including the needs for medication and shelter, of intoxicated persons, and shall also provide for initial examination, diagnosis and referral.  To the extent possible, such treatment centers shall be affiliated with a general or other hospital.


b. Inpatient facilities, for treatment of persons with an alcohol use disorder, which shall, to the extent possible, be affiliated with the medical service of a general hospital, mental hospital, community mental health center, or other hospital.


c. Outpatient facilities.


d. Residential aftercare facilities, such as halfway houses.
The department shall maintain, supervise and control all facilities operated by it pursuant to P.L.1975, c. 305 (

Services delivered by the department pursuant to P.L.1975, c. 305 (
C.26:2B-7 et seq.

The department shall prepare and publish annually a list of all services operating in accordance with P.L.1975, c. 305 (
C.26:2B-7 et seq.

New Jersey Statutes Title 43. Pensions and Retirement and Unemployment Compensation 43 § 21-57,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-43-pensions-and-retirement-and-unemployment-compensation/nj-st-sect-43-21-57.html,"
a. During the 1980s, New Jersey employers reported serious difficulties in finding skilled workers for a wide range of jobs in key sectors of the State's economy, and, notwithstanding the current economic slowdown, a longterm shortage of skilled labor will continue in many parts of the State's economy during the 1990s and beyond;


b. In addition, many New Jersey businesses are also hindered by low levels of literacy and other basic skills among a significant minority of the workforce;


c. Basic workplace literacy and vocational skill levels must be raised if the industries and enterprises of this State are to be successful in an increasingly competitive global economy;


d. Because of a slowing rate of population growth, the retraining of the existing workforce will play a critical role in meeting the growing need for skilled labor;


e. The effectiveness of current programs to retrain displaced workers during the time that they receive unemployment benefits is hindered by the limited duration of those benefits, which often drives displaced workers into short-term retraining programs with limited skill enhancement or results in the programs' avoiding the selection of trainees who need more extensive training to succeed;


f. It would increase the effectiveness of programs which provide retraining to displaced workers if the unemployment benefit period could be extended in cases where the longer benefit period is necessary to provide needed in-depth education and training;


g. Such extended unemployment benefits in connection with job training and education would encourage displaced workers to make greater use of retraining opportunities, thus making productive use of periods of economic slowdown and helping to close the skilled labor shortage during the growth periods that follow;


h. New Jersey's Unemployment Compensation Fund, with its current balance of more than two billion dollars, is among the most solvent in the nation;


i. It is therefore an appropriate public purpose, beneficial to workers and employers and the longterm economic development of New Jersey, to use a limited amount of unemployment compensation funds to provide extended unemployment benefits as needed to enable displaced workers to obtain the high quality training and education required for success in occupations where there are demonstrated longterm shortages of skilled labor.

a. The Legislature finds that the people of the State have a paramount interest in the restoration, maintenance and preservation of the quality of the waters of the State for the protection and preservation of public health and welfare, food supplies, public water supplies, propagation of fish and wildlife, agricultural and industrial uses, aesthetic satisfaction, recreation, and other beneficial uses;  and that the severity of the water pollution problem in the State necessitates continuing water quality management planning in order to develop and implement water quality programs in concert with other social and economic objectives.  The Legislature further finds that water quality is dependent upon factors of topography, hydrology, population concentration, industrial and commercial development, agricultural uses, transportation and other such factors which vary among and within watersheds and other regions of the State and that pollution abatement programs should consider these natural and man-made conditions that influence water quality.  The Legislature further finds that the State's groundwaters are a precious and vulnerable resource.


b. The Legislature declares that the objective of this act is, wherever attainable, to restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the waters of the State, including groundwaters, and the public trust therein;  and that areawide waste treatment management planning processes should be developed and implemented in order to achieve this objective and to assure adequate control of sources of water pollutants in the State.  The Legislature further declares that wherever practicable and feasible waste treatment management planning areas shall be coterminous with county boundaries, and that wherever appropriate county governments shall perform such areawide waste treatment management planning;  that the Department of Environmental Protection shall conduct areawide waste treatment management planning for all areas of the State without a designated planning agency, and that said Department of Environmental Protection shall establish a continuing planning process which will encourage, direct, supervise and aid areawide planning and which will also incorporate water quality management plans into a comprehensive and cohesive Statewide program directed toward the achievement of water quality objectives;  that the Department of Environmental Protection through the continuing planning process and the planning agencies through the areawide planning process shall coordinate and integrate water quality management plans with related Federal, State, regional and local comprehensive land use, functional and other relevant planning activities, programs and policies;  and that opportunities for meaningful public participation shall be provided during all phases of the water quality planning management process.

b. The exposure of our children and others to this unrelenting barrage of negative images has led to the erosion and denigration of Italian-American culture, history and heritage.  It has, furthermore, encouraged children to emulate negative role models and promoted the social acceptability of disrespect for and bigotry towards Italians and Americans of Italian heritage and their culture, history and heritage--a culture, history and heritage shared by over 22 percent of New Jersey's population.


c. The histories of our nation and our State have been significantly enriched by the heritage of Italians and Americans of Italian heritage.  The cultural heritage of Italy includes the classical civilization of Rome, the fine arts of the Renaissance, the scientific and artistic genius of Da Vinci, the literary works of Dante and Petrarch, the operas of Verdi and Puccini and many other contributions that have ennobled civilization.


d. More than 5.4 million Italians emigrated to the United States between the years 1820 and 1991;  today more than 2 million citizens of this State are of Italian descent.  Our nation and our State have benefitted substantially from the influences and contributions of these men, women and children and their distinctive culture, history and heritage.


e. It is desirable to educate our citizens about the positive aspects of the culture, music, art, language, history and heritage of Italians and Americans of Italian heritage.


f. It is the policy of the State of New Jersey that the culture, history and heritage of Italians and Americans of Italian heritage are a proper concern for all people, particularly students enrolled in the schools of this State.


g. It is appropriate and desirable that programs, workshops, institutes, seminars and other teacher-training activities for the study of the culture, history and heritage of Italians and Americans of Italian heritage be conducted at the various high schools and institutions of higher education in this State.


h. It is fitting and proper to establish a permanent State-level commission to survey, design, encourage and promote the implementation of Italian and Americans of Italian heritage cultural and educational programs in this State, with responsibility for the coordination of events that will provide appropriate awareness and memorialization of the culture, history, heritage and language of Italians and Americans of Italian heritage on a regular basis throughout the State.

a. The major problems and objectives relating to land development in the municipality at the time of the adoption of the last reexamination report.


b. The extent to which such problems and objectives have been reduced or have increased subsequent to such date.

(a) The master plan shall include provisions or criteria for the location and use of buildings, structures, facilities, and land for solid waste disposal, and may include provisions for:  (1) the use of land and buildings, residential, commercial, industrial, mining, agricultural, park and other like purposes;  (2) service-water supply, utilities, sewerage, and other like matters;  (3) transportation, streets, parking, public transit lines and stations both above and below ground level, freight facilities, airports, harbors, channels, docks and wharves, and other like matters;  (4) housing, residential standards, clearance, redevelopment, rehabilitation, conservation, and other like matters;  (5) water, forest, soil conservation, flood control, and other like matters;  (6) public and semipublic facilities including but not limited to civic centers, schools, libraries, parks, playgrounds, fire houses, police buildings, hospitals, and other like matters;  (7) the distribution and density of population;  (8) planned unit development;  (9) community appearance;  (10) financing and programming capital improvements;  (11) and other related elements of growth and development, including the social implications of any proposed development, and advances in technology related to any subject included in the plan.


(b) The plan may also include codes and standards covering land use, comprehensive zoning, subdivisions, building construction and design, housing, and the control of air and water pollution and solid waste disposal which has been approved by the State Department of Health, and other subjects necessary to carry out the plan or to undertake a workable program of community improvement.  No codes or standards concerning building construction and design shall be promulgated without the certificate of the chief engineer or equivalent official of the commission that the proposed codes and standards meet the engineering standards adopted by the commission.  No municipality shall enact or enforce any code which is inconsistent with the code contained in the master plan insofar as such code applies to property within the district;  provided, however, that the governing body or other appropriate body of each constituent municipality may enact zoning ordinances and any other codes or standards, which it is authorized by the laws of this State to enact, for lands within the boundaries of said municipality which are subject to the jurisdiction of the commission and which will effectuate the purposes of the commission's master plan.

a. Despite significant advances in diagnosis, treatment and prevention, stroke remains a common disorder;  an estimated 700,000 to 750,000 new and recurrent strokes occur each year in this country;  and with the aging of the population, the number of persons who have strokes is projected to increase;


b. Although new treatments are available to improve the clinical outcomes of stroke, many acute care hospitals lack the necessary staff and equipment to optimally triage and treat stroke patients, including the provision of optimal, safe and effective emergency care for these patients;


c. Two levels of stroke centers should be established for the treatment of acute stroke.  Primary stroke centers should be established in as many acute care hospitals as possible.  These centers would evaluate, stabilize and provide emergency care to patients with acute stroke and then, depending on the patient's needs and the center's capabilities, either admit the patient and provide inpatient care or transfer the patient to a comprehensive stroke center.  Comprehensive stroke centers should be established in hospitals that meet the criteria set forth in this act, to ensure coverage for all patients throughout the State who require this level of care.  These centers would provide complete and specialized care to patients who experience the most complex strokes, which require specialized testing, highly technical procedures and other interventions.  Also, these centers would provide education and guidance to affiliated primary stroke centers;


d. There is a public health need for acute care hospitals in this State to establish stroke centers to ensure the rapid triage, diagnostic evaluation and treatment of patients suffering a stroke.  This should result in increased survival and a decrease in the disabilities associated with stroke;  and


e. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the residents of this State to establish a program to designate stroke centers throughout the State, to provide specific patient care and support services criteria that stroke centers must meet in order to ensure that stroke patients receive safe and effective care, and to provide financial support to acute care hospitals to encourage them to develop stroke centers in all areas of the State.

(2) The benefits of implemented programs and activities aimed at preventing or controlling diabetes.  This assessment shall document the amount and source of any funding directed to each department for programs and activities aimed at reaching those with diabetes;


(3) The level of coordination among the three departments and the divisions and agencies thereof on activities, programmatic activities, and messaging related to the management, treatment, or prevention of all forms of diabetes and its complications;


(4) The development or revision of a detailed action plan for preventing and controlling diabetes with a range of actionable items for consideration by the Legislature.  The plan shall identify proposed actions to reduce the impact of all forms of diabetes, pre-diabetes, and complications related to diabetes;  identify expected outcomes of the proposed actions in the following biennium;  and establish benchmarks for preventing and controlling relevant forms of diabetes, reducing the incidence of diabetes, improving diabetes care, and controlling complications associated with diabetes;  and


(5) The development of a detailed budget blueprint identifying needs, costs, and resources required to implement the plan pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection.  This blueprint shall include a budget range for each proposed action presented in the plan pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subsection for consideration by the Legislature.

a. New Jersey must improve the ability of its child welfare system to protect children from abuse and neglect, and to provide services to at-risk children and families in order to prevent harm to their children;


b. Recent data and assessments of the child welfare system in this State demonstrate the need for a new approach to delivering services to this vulnerable population, and the system must therefore be reformed;


c. Because the safety of children must always be paramount, allegations of child abuse and neglect must be investigated quickly and thoroughly and protective actions must be taken immediately if necessary;


d. Concerns about the safety, permanency and well-being of children require significant changes in:  the organization of the child welfare system, the ability to implement best practices within the system;  the development of effective services to meet the needs of children and families;  and the elimination of impediments to the quick and efficient management of abuse and neglect cases;


e. Children need safe, stable and positive relationships with caring adults in order to thrive;  and, if their parents are incapable of providing such a caring relationship, the State must look to other families to provide this kind of relationship;


f. To ensure the best outcomes for children and their families, these substitute families must be viewed and treated as “resource families” and provided with appropriate support, training and responsibilities, which will include:  expedited licensure for this purpose, equalized payment rates for care among the various types of resource families, and enhanced access to necessary support services tailored to their respective needs;


g. Youths must be provided with supports and services in their communities that will enable them to grow into healthy and productive adults;  and those youths who previously received child welfare services must continue to receive those services beyond the age of 18, up to age 21, as appropriate;  and

l. This act will otherwise enhance the quality of the child welfare system in New Jersey by facilitating the transition to other needed long-term systemic changes with regard to out-of-home placements and permanency options for children who cannot live with their birth families.

a. That entrepreneurship is a vital component of the national heritage that fosters the health and dynamism of the overall economy;


b. That despite their contribution as major generators of employment, small businesses are struggling to survive in the private sector;


c. That due to a historical legacy of disregard and discrimination, minorities and women control a disproportionately small fraction of the productive resources of the State and are therefore largely excluded from the mainstream of the overall economy;


d. That the problems of inadequate capital and management expertise that pertain to businesses owned by minorities and women are the same problems that pertain, in varying degrees, to all small businesses;


e. That the public sector at both the national and State levels has recognized the appropriateness of the role of encouraging small businesses generally and women and minorities in particular;


f. That the continuing disparity of capital accumulation in the South Jersey region has hampered the survival of small entrepreneurs and the economic development and independence of minorities and women, and has limited opportunities for enterprise development by individuals from each of these populations;


g. That economic development within the small business and minority communities and among women increases the prosperity of the entire State by generating revenues and reducing the State burden of unemployment, welfare and other supportive social services;


h. That in order to promote these goals it is necessary to establish a permanent government entity, an authority, with a long-term mandate for the delivery of financial and overall assistance to small businesses and businesses owned by minorities and women;


i. That the authority shall focus efforts clearly on areas of greatest need and shall have a commitment toward the establishment of quality programs;


j. That the authority shall be responsible, both directly and as an intermediary, for providing financing and for coordinating a wide range of intensive and ongoing business expertise;


k. That the authority shall pursue its mandate in accordance with a well-conceived business strategy and underwriting standards that approximate those utilized by traditional lenders;


l. That the authority's success in fulfilling its mandate shall be measured by the ultimate viability of the enterprises it assists.

a. According to the American Association of Retired Professional's Public Policy Institute, at any given time, an estimated 1.75 million people in New Jersey provide varying degrees of unreimbursed care to adults with limitations in daily activities.  The total value of the unpaid care to individuals in need of long-term services and supports amounts to an estimated $13 billion per year.


b. Caregivers are often members of the individual's immediate family, but friends and other community members also serve as caregivers.  Although most caregivers are asked to assist an individual with basic activities of daily living, such as mobility, eating, and dressing, many are expected to perform complex tasks on a daily basis, such as administering multiple medications, providing wound care, and operating medical equipment.


c. Despite the vast importance of caregivers in the individual's day-to-day care, and despite the fact that 78 percent of caregivers report managing multiple medications, administering injections, and performing other health maintenance tasks, research has shown that many caregivers feel that they do not have the necessary skill set to perform the caregiving tasks they are asked to perform when a loved one is discharged from the hospital.


d. The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates that $17 billion in Medicare funds is spent each year on unnecessary hospital readmissions.  Additionally, hospitals desire to avoid the imposition of new readmission penalties under the federal “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,” 
Pub.L.111-148
, as amended by the “Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010,” 
Pub.L.111-152
 (ACA). 1


e. In order to successfully address the challenges of a surging population of older adults and others who have significant needs for long-term services and supports, the State must develop methods to enable caregivers to continue to support their loved ones at home and in the community, and avoid costly hospital readmissions.


f. The New Jersey Hospital Association and hospitals in its Hospital Engagement Network have utilized transitional caregiver models to reduce readmissions by over 13 percent from January 2012 to December 2013, leading to 5,492 fewer patients being readmitted during that time, at a cost savings of over $52 million.


g. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that this act enables caregivers to provide competent post-hospital care to their family and other loved ones, at minimal cost to the taxpayers of this State.

a. Upon review of the Extraordinarily Hazardous Substance Accident Risk Assessment for each facility, the department shall, if appropriate, order the owner or operator of the facility to undertake an extraordinarily hazardous substance risk reduction plan.  The order shall identify the risk or risks which must, within the limits of practicability and feasibility, be abated and a reasonable timetable for implementation of the plan.  The department shall, by regulation, establish criteria or quantitative standards for determining risk, which criteria and standards shall reflect, among other factors, the size of the potentially exposed population and the gravity of consequences.  The commissioner may order those operations posing the identified risk or risks that have not been abated on schedule to cease until the risk reduction plan has been implemented.


b. The owner of a facility who is aggrieved by an order issued pursuant to subsection a. of this section may petition the commissioner for a review of the matter, pursuant to which he shall provide the commissioner with all data and documents which he believes demonstrate that the order is unwarranted.  If the commissioner, after review, affirms the initial order, he shall, at the request of the aggrieved owner, transmit all relevant materials and documents on the matter to the Office of Administrative Law, which shall conduct a hearing on the order pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1978, c. 67 (
C. 52:14F-1 et seq.

C. 52:14B-1 et seq.
).  The department and the aggrieved owner of the facility shall be deemed parties in interest in the proceeding.  Intervention in this hearing by any other person shall be as provided in the “Administrative Procedure Act.”  After review of the record of the adjudicatory proceeding and the recommendation of the administrative law judge, the commissioner shall affirm or modify his order.  The decision of the commissioner shall constitute final agency action on the matter, and shall be subject only to judicial review as provided in the Rules of Court.  During the pendency of the review and the hearing, the timetable for compliance with the order giving rise to the proceeding shall be suspended.

a. As one of the nation's most densely populated States and one of the earliest settled, New Jersey is beset by a host of urban problems attendant upon economic obsolescence, an aging infrastructure, long-term underinvestment and de-industrialization;


b. Although the State Development and Redevelopment Plan has fostered a more coordinated and integrated State planning process and has placed renewed emphasis on urban revitalization goals, the realization of those revitalization goals still presents a critical challenge to the private sector and the myriad of governmental entities whose policies touch urban areas;


c. The rapid pace of technological change with which the late twentieth century is associated, represented by the development and growth of the “information superhighway,” and increasing world competition, spurred on by recent and ongoing international free trade agreements, threatens to further marginalize our already distressed and beleaguered urban centers;


d. Environmentally compromised sites present a particular challenge to the State's urban centers, particularly those with major associated cleanup liability and, notwithstanding the impressive strides taken by this Legislature to address remediation issues, further remedies are necessary in order to imbue those sites with renewed economic potential;


e. Given the number of years over which these problems have developed and in light of the enormity of the challenges which lay ahead, it is incumbent upon this Legislature to designate an entity that has as its primary focus the State's urban centers, and to provide that entity with resources to effectuate renewal in these urban areas;


f. At present, a vast and complex network of State agencies and policies which should cooperate in the identification and resolution of urban problems too often work at cross-purposes and so it is vital that this new entity bring together those agencies whose policies are most strongly felt in urban areas in order to promote their economic and social viability in a coordinated fashion;


g. There is a need for a redevelopment agency whose focus is developing and implementing strategic revitalization plans and neighborhood empowerment plans for urban neighborhoods to serve as the State's primary community development agency with particular focus on technical assistance, grants, low and no interest loans, loan guarantees, and capacity building for community development organizations;  and


h. This legislative initiative is intended to implement the urban redevelopment initiative concept and philosophy articulated by the sponsor which calls for the establishment of an independent entity which will allow for a coordinated approach to urban revitalization and succeed in achieving its goals where previous urban efforts have failed.

b. The commissioner shall, within 60 days of receipt of a completed application and upon review of the application as to sufficiency and conformity with the purposes of this act, (1) by order designate a district and delineate its boundaries in conformance with the application, or (2) disapprove the application and inform the governing body of the county in writing of the reasons for the disapproval, or (3) where the commissioner finds that the creation of a district is critically important and that the application of the county is sufficient in every respect except the appropriateness of the proposed boundaries for the district, by order designate a district and delineate its boundaries and inform the governing body of the county in writing of the reasons for the alteration of the proposed boundaries.  Failure of the commissioner to act under this subsection within 60 days, unless the applicant agrees to an extension of time shall mean that the application is approved and the commissioner shall then on the next business day issue an order as required under this subsection.  The governing body may, in the case of a disapproval of its application, resubmit an application incorporating whatever revisions it deems appropriate, taking into consideration the commissioner's reasons for disapproval.



c. (1) If the governing body of the county in response to a petition by a municipality under section 15 of this act adopts an ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, stating its intention not to proceed with an application or adopts an ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, stating its intention to proceed with an application but fails to submit such an application within 120 days of adopting that ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, the governing body of the municipality which submitted the original petition or the governing body of any municipality within the county which would be directly affected by the designation and delineation of a district may petition the commissioner for the designation and delineation of a district.  The commissioner shall, within 60 days of receipt of a petition and upon review of the petition as to sufficiency and conformity with the purposes of this act, act as in subsection b. of this section, but in the instance where the commissioner acts under paragraph (1) or paragraph (3) of subsection b., the commissioner shall also designate an appropriate governmental organization which has sufficient power to administer the district, and which shall permit representation from all participating municipalities.  In addition, where negotiations are underway pursuant to this subsection or subsection b. of this section between the department and the petitioning body the 60 day time frame may be suspended by mutual agreement.  The petitioning body may, in the case of a disapproval of its application, resubmit a petition directly to the commissioner incorporating whatever revisions it deems appropriate, taking into consideration the commissioner's reasons for disapproval.


(2) Failure by a county to adopt a resolution stating its intent to submit an application substantially consistent with the municipal petition within 90 days after receipt thereof shall entitle the petitioning municipality or any directly affected municipality to petition the commissioner for the designation and delineation of a district as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection.



c. (1) If the governing body of the county in response to a petition by a municipality under section 15 of this act adopts an ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, stating its intention not to proceed with an application or adopts an ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, stating its intention to proceed with an application but fails to submit such an application within 120 days of adopting that ordinance or resolution, as appropriate, the governing body of the municipality which submitted the original petition or the governing body of any municipality within the county which would be directly affected by the designation and delineation of a district may petition the commissioner for the designation and delineation of a district.  The commissioner shall, within 60 days of receipt of a petition and upon review of the petition as to sufficiency and conformity with the purposes of this act, act as in subsection b. of this section, but in the instance where the commissioner acts under paragraph (1) or paragraph (3) of subsection b., the commissioner shall also designate an appropriate governmental organization which has sufficient power to administer the district, and which shall permit representation from all participating municipalities.  In addition, where negotiations are underway pursuant to this subsection or subsection b. of this section between the department and the petitioning body the 60 day time frame may be suspended by mutual agreement.  The petitioning body may, in the case of a disapproval of its application, resubmit a petition directly to the commissioner incorporating whatever revisions it deems appropriate, taking into consideration the commissioner's reasons for disapproval.


(2) Failure by a county to adopt a resolution stating its intent to submit an application substantially consistent with the municipal petition within 90 days after receipt thereof shall entitle the petitioning municipality or any directly affected municipality to petition the commissioner for the designation and delineation of a district as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection.


d. The commissioner shall adopt as regulations under the “Administrative Procedure Act,” P.L.1968, c.410 (

a. In 1976, the voters of the State approved an amendment to the 
New Jersey Constitution (Article IV, Section VII, paragraph 2
, subparagraph D), which authorized casino gaming in Atlantic City.


b. For over 30 years, casinos grew and profited in the City of Atlantic City, until competition from other states in our region, particularly Pennsylvania, siphoned off much of the out-of-State and foreign gamblers who had frequented Atlantic City casinos for many years.


c. The regional competition in casino gaming has had a deleterious effect on Atlantic City in several ways, including:  an increase in unemployment due to the recent closing of four casino properties, representing fully one-third of the number of casinos operating in Atlantic City in 2013;  a strain on Atlantic City's municipal budget due to property tax refunds required by successful assessment appeals of casino gaming properties;  and an increased property tax burden on Atlantic City and Atlantic County residents based on the decreasing value of casino gaming properties.


d. In the “New Jersey Economic Opportunity Act of 2013,” 
P.L.2013, c. 161
 (
C.52:27D-489p
 et al.), the four New Jersey cities with the lowest median family income based on the 2009 American Community Survey from the United States Census (Table 708.  Household, Family, and Per Capita Income and Individuals, and Families Below Poverty Level by City:  2009) were designated as Garden State Growth Zones and were declared blighted areas and areas in need of rehabilitation;  provided, however, that the declaration alone could not be used to allow any property to be taken or acquired.


e. The Legislature has previously recognized the extraordinary situation in Atlantic City, by designating a municipality which contains a tourism district as established pursuant to section 5 of 
P.L.2011, c. 18
 (
C.5:12-219
) and regulated by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority as a Garden State Growth Zone for purposes of incentive programs administered by the New Jersey Economic Development Authority in 
P.L.2014, c. 63
 (
C.34:1B-251
 et al.).


f. Consistent with the Legislature's acts with respect to the other Garden State Growth Zones, a municipality which contains a tourism district as established pursuant to section 5 of 
P.L.2011, c. 18
 (
C.5:12-219
) and is regulated by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority is hereby declared a blighted area and area in need of redevelopment;  provided, however, that this declaration alone shall not be used to allow any property to be taken or acquired.


g. The accurate assessment of casino gaming properties is especially difficult because they are unique properties and their year-to-year value is greatly influenced by the performance of casino gaming properties in other nearby states and by extreme weather events like Super Storm Sandy.


h. It is appropriate for the Legislature to address the extraordinary situation in Atlantic City by devising a program that avoids costly assessment appeals for both the casino operators and Atlantic City, and that provides a certain mandatory minimum property-tax related payment by casino properties that Atlantic City can rely upon each year.


i. 
Article VIII, Section I, paragraph 2 of the New Jersey Constitution
 empowers the Legislature to grant property tax exemptions by general law.


j. It is constitutional to classify Atlantic City, the only municipality wherein casino gaming is authorized, as a special class unto itself for economic purposes related to casino gaming.  Courts have routinely concluded that the Legislature has the ability to address the concerns of Atlantic City and the casino industry separately from other local entities and industries due to the unique role casino gambling plays in Atlantic City and the State.  The fact that, even though almost 40 years have passed since the approval of casino gambling in New Jersey, Atlantic City remains the only municipality wherein casino gaming is authorized, proves that its unique classification continues to allow the Legislature to treat it as a special case under State law, and permits changes to the casino “experiment” in Atlantic City.


k. Casino gaming properties represent a unique classification of property that can be exempted from normal property taxation by general law, in favor of a certain guaranteed mandatory minimum payment in lieu of property taxes when it is primarily in the public interest to do so.


l. In the interest of the revitalization of Atlantic City and the continuation of the casino industry and its associated economic benefits to the State, it is reasonable that the Legislature, in seeking to revitalize the city, should choose to experiment with a payment in lieu of property tax mechanism to address the issues of persistent property tax appeals and the damage that those appeals, together with declining casino property values, have wrought on the tax bases of both Atlantic City and Atlantic County.


m. It is a primary public purpose to grant casino gaming properties an exemption from normal property taxation for a limited period of time, in exchange for a guaranteed mandatory minimum payment in lieu of property taxes, because Atlantic City will be able to depend on a certain level of revenue from casino gaming properties each year, making the local property tax rate and need for State aid less volatile;  casino revenue supports many social programs, such as property tax relief for seniors, medical assistance, housing for disabled residents, transportation assistance, and other social services programs for elderly and disabled New Jerseyans;  casinos provide a unique recreational experience to the residents of New Jersey within the State;  and because, with a long-term predictable payment in lieu of property tax liability, casino gaming properties will know how much of their income will be required to pay their obligation to Atlantic City, Atlantic County, and the Atlantic City School District.  This ability to depend on a stable payment in lieu of property tax obligation will in turn help to stabilize the casino business models and the workforce required to run those business models, and the casino gaming properties will be better able to compete with out-of-State casino gaming properties in the region to preserve, and perhaps grow, the many benefits that casino gaming has brought to the State, and more particularly, to the Atlantic City region.


n. It is also a primary public purpose to stabilize the casino industry for the benefit of the casino employee workforce, many of whom have worked in the casinos since the first casino opened over 30 years ago.  It is anticipated that the financial stability granted to the casino gaming properties by a guaranteed mandatory minimum payment in lieu of property taxes for a 10-year period will greatly enhance the ability of the casino gaming properties to adapt their business models to the changes in the regional casino gaming market, which will in turn allow them to remain open for business and to pay their employees good wages and benefits, including health care and pension benefits, for many years to come.


o. This plan to provide a guaranteed minimum in lieu of property tax payment for 10 years, and ending casino property tax appeal litigation would provide some economic stabilization to Atlantic City and allow it time to plan for its future, which it cannot do if it descends further into an economic free-fall.


p. The public purpose of a property tax exemption and payment in lieu of property tax program for casino gaming properties seems evident without examining the specific local, regional, and Statewide economic benefits of the continued success of the casino industry and the general economic viability of Atlantic City.  Arguably, the local, regional, and State economies could be bolstered by such a property tax exemption and, thus, be seen by a court as a primary public purpose furthered by the legislation.  The exemption of casino property from property taxation is a proper exercise of the Legislature's power to grant property tax exemptions by general law, since Atlantic City casinos are a unique classification which does not exclude any similar properties in the State.  Such an exemption primarily furthers several public purposes, while providing an incidental benefit to casino properties.


q. The Legislature intends to request in the budget process that $10,000,000 is appropriated for economic development projects in Atlantic City and that $8,000,000 is appropriated for funding for the promotion, marketing, and advertising of the City of Atlantic City.  Any amount so appropriated to Atlantic City shall not impact, reduce, or otherwise affect the amount appropriated for Transitional Aid to Localities.

New Jersey Statutes Title 18A. Education 18A § 71C-51,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-18a-education/nj-st-sect-18a-71c-51.html,"
a. This State is experiencing a critical shortage in its nursing workforce, which is expected to worsen in the next two decades.  In New Jersey, as well as nationwide, the shortage of faculty in schools of nursing is reaching crisis proportions.  Insufficient numbers of faculty hinder schools' efforts to increase their capacity.


b. According to projections by the Health Resources and Services Administration of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, New Jersey is estimated to be 49% below demand, resulting in a shortfall of 42,400 registered professional nurse full-time equivalent positions throughout the State by 2020.


c. The demand for nurses at all levels of training and in all health care settings, including hospitals, nursing homes, veterans' homes and home health care and community-based programs, is increasing as the population gets older.  Recent data from schools of nursing in New Jersey show that there is an increased interest in nursing by potential students;  67% of schools of nursing in the State turned away qualified student applicants and 57% report numbers of enrollments greater than their current capacity to educate students.


d. The average age of New Jersey's registered professional nurses and licensed practical nurses is increasing each year;  in 2007 54.4% of the State's registered professional nurses were between 46 and 60 years of age and 13.3% were more than 60 years of age;  29% of non-retired registered professional nurses were older than 55 years of age.  These findings indicate that, assuming the majority of nurses retire at 65 years of age, the State will need to replace one third of its nursing workforce over the next 10 years.


e. The number of full-time faculty positions currently budgeted in New Jersey's schools of nursing totals 575 full-time equivalents.  Of these, six percent, or 35 full-time equivalents, were vacant in October 2004;  54% of the nursing schools in the State reported faculty vacancies.


f. The faculty shortage is part of the larger picture and all areas must be addressed as nurses are vital to the public's health.  Research indicates that without sufficient numbers of well-qualified nurses, patients' lives and well-being are at increased risk.  The minimum educational requirement of a nursing instructor according to the New Jersey Board of Nursing regulations is a master's degree in nursing (MSN).  For nursing faculty in the State's 13 associate degree programs in community colleges and 11 diploma programs in hospitals, a MSN is required.  Many schools also require that faculty be certified in the specialty practice area in which they teach.

C.52:18A-196 et seq.
), is a process designed to elicit the greatest degree of public participation in order to encourage the development of a consensus among the many, sometimes competing, interests in the State.


e. This consensus will be facilitated by the availability of sufficient information concerning the impact the State Development and Redevelopment Plan may have on particular regions and on the overall economic well-being of the State.


f. The Plan evolves through three phases:

(1) the Preliminary Plan, which will serve as the basis for cross-acceptance;


(2) the Interim Plan, which will reflect the changes occurring during the cross-acceptance process;  and


(3) the Final Plan, which is to be implemented after approval by the State Planning Commission.



(1) the Preliminary Plan, which will serve as the basis for cross-acceptance;


(2) the Interim Plan, which will reflect the changes occurring during the cross-acceptance process;  and


(3) the Final Plan, which is to be implemented after approval by the State Planning Commission.


g. A two-stage process shall be established to examine the economic, environmental, infrastructure, community life, and intergovernmental coordination impacts of the Plan.  This procedure shall consist of an assessment of the impacts of the Interim Plan and an on-going monitoring and evaluation program after the Final Plan is adopted.


h. The results of the Assessment Study shall identify desirable changes to be incorporated into the Final Plan.  These studies shall describe the impacts of the policies and strategies proposed in the Plan (hereafter referred to as the “Plan” impacts) relative to the impacts that would likely occur without a Plan (hereafter referred to as “Trend” impacts).  In examining the impacts of Plan and Trend, any significant regional differences that result shall be identified and analyzed.  Where appropriate, the study shall also distinguish short-term and long-term impacts.


i. It is necessary to conduct an economic assessment of the Plan and Trend impacts and to make the results of that assessment available before adoption of the Final Plan.  Work on the development of the evaluation methodology and, where possible, the collection of data for the assessment study shall commence upon enactment of this bill.  Some factors that shall be addressed during cross-acceptance include:

(1) Changes in property values, including farmland, State and local expenditures and tax revenues, and regulations;


(2) Changes in housing supply, housing prices, employment, population and income;


(3) Costs of providing the infrastructure systems identified in the State Planning Act;


(4) Costs of preserving the natural resources as identified in the State Planning Act;  1


(5) Changes in business climate;  and


(6) Changes in the agricultural industry and the costs of preserving farmland and open spaces.

"New Jersey Statutes Title 52. State Government, Departments and Officers 52 § 27D-489b",https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-52-state-government-departments-and-officers/nj-st-sect-52-27d-489b.html,"
a. The State of New Jersey is confronting a fiscal and economic crisis more severe than any experienced since the Great Depression.  Counties and municipalities are likewise witnessing dramatic reductions in local revenues as a consequence of the global economic recession.  As part of an ongoing, coordinated attempt to spur economic improvement and reverse this deflationary cycle, the Legislature and the Governor recently enacted a number of laws designed to minimize the impact of current conditions on New Jersey businesses and residents, including legislation providing incentives to create jobs and make business investments in this State.


b. America has seen two economic changes since the birth of our nation over two hundred years ago.  The initial change from an agrarian based economy to an industrial based economy in the revolution of the mid to late 1800s caused a realignment of our culture and population and brought prosperity to millions of our hardworking citizens.  Much more recently, during those years culminating in the end of the 20th century, the rise of technology and financial services was our second change and increased that prosperity many fold.


c. As a consequence of the current world-wide financial crisis, opportunities for New Jersey residents to achieve prosperity have now shrunk.  Many of our citizens are facing economic hardships not seen since the Great Depression.  The financial crisis has diminished the ability of the private sector to create economic development on its own.  The worldwide drop in available capital along with a self-fulfilling drop in consumer confidence has created a downward spiral that can be overcome with the assistance of a partnership--a public-private partnership that targets tax cuts to drive economic development and job creation.


d. The poor economic climate continues to pose particular challenges for private sector entities desiring to engage in job creation and economic development activities.  In order to spur economic growth and improve the quality of life for all New Jersey residents, it is appropriate for the Legislature to revisit, modify, and supplement several of the current statutes governing economic development and related activities in this State, including but not limited to job creation, economic growth, tax credits, state and local taxation of manufacturing and other activities, higher education, redevelopment, and affordable housing.  Each of the facets of 
P.L.2009, c. 90
 (
C.52:27D-489a
 et al.) represents a direct response to the unique economic development challenges currently facing the State and local units.  It is the belief of the Legislature that each of the individual components of 
P.L.2009, c. 90
 (
C.52:27D-489a
 et al.) will serve to combat one or more aspects of the current economic crisis and that these complementary components will promote economic development and job creation activities immediately upon enactment.


e. Current economic conditions compel bold and timely action to create a third economic change that will enhance our prosperity and build confidence in our future.  That prosperity must be extended to all areas of New Jersey, urban, suburban, and rural, and include all sectors of the State's economy.


f. Through the use of tax increment financing, tax credits, development fee suspensions, and dedicated economic development revenues, along with a more efficient redevelopment process, New Jersey will be able to restore its economy to economic health and create good-paying jobs for its residents;  assist the private development of affordable housing;  assist institutions of higher education to develop needed classrooms, laboratories, dormitory rooms, and other educational facilities;  and generate revenues for necessary State and local governmental services.

New Jersey Statutes Title 26. Health and Vital Statistics 26 § 15-1,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-26-health-and-vital-statistics/nj-st-sect-26-15-1.html,"
a. There are an estimated 1.25 million residents of the State who have no health insurance coverage, of which over 240,000 are children, and the number of uninsured residents is increasing each year;


b. While employer-sponsored health care coverage in the State is well above the national average and has been a major factor in keeping the number of uninsured lower than in many states, because of the rising cost of the coverage, increasing numbers of employers are considering dropping coverage for their employees and dependents, or are requiring employees to share in a greater percentage of premium costs and to bear larger copayments and coinsurance, which is making health care coverage increasingly unaffordable to low and moderate income working families;


c. Persons without health insurance coverage receive less preventive care, poorer treatment for both minor and serious chronic and acute illnesses, and in many cases live shorter lives than comparable insured populations;


d. Many uninsured are forced to seek health care in inappropriate settings such as hospital emergency rooms because they cannot obtain needed health care services in a convenient and more cost-effective setting such as a primary care provider's office or clinic, which contributes to higher health care costs;


e. The uninsured are commonly billed at higher rates than those who have health care coverage.  Health care costs have become a leading cause of bankruptcy in this country, and those without insurance are most at risk;


f. The State has recognized the importance of increasing access to health care coverage and, over the last several years, has enacted several reforms to make health care coverage more affordable and accessible to residents of the State.  Among these reforms are the expansions of coverage under the State Medicaid and NJ FamilyCare programs.  Despite these efforts, too many low income parents and children lack access to health care coverage;


g. In order to ensure that more low income parents in the State have access to health care coverage and all children in the State are covered under a health plan, thus moving closer to providing universal coverage for all residents of this State, it is necessary to further expand coverage for parents under the NJ FamilyCare Program, and mandate that all children in the State have health care coverage, either through public programs or private coverage;  and


h. In order to make insurance coverage more affordable to residents and small businesses in this State, and to stabilize enrollment in, and the costs of, individual and small employer health benefits plans, it is also necessary to adopt comprehensive reform measures to the insurance marketplace.

"New Jersey Statutes Title 52. State Government, Departments and Officers 52 § 18A-196",https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-52-state-government-departments-and-officers/nj-st-sect-52-18a-196.html,"
a. New Jersey, the nation's most densely populated State, requires sound and integrated Statewide planning and the coordination of Statewide planning with local and regional planning in order to conserve its natural resources, revitalize its urban centers, protect the quality of its environment, preserve the vitality of federal military facilities, and provide needed housing and adequate public services at a reasonable cost while promoting beneficial economic growth, development and renewal;


b. Significant economies, efficiencies and savings in the development process would be realized by private sector enterprise and by public sector development agencies if the several levels of government would cooperate in the preparation of and adherence to sound and integrated plans;


c. It is of urgent importance that the State Development Guide Plan be replaced by a State Development and Redevelopment Plan designed for use as a tool for assessing suitable locations for infrastructure, housing, economic growth and conservation;


d. It is in the public interest to encourage development, redevelopment and economic growth in locations that are well situated with respect to present or anticipated public services and facilities, giving appropriate priority to the redevelopment, repair, rehabilitation or replacement of existing facilities, and to discourage development where it may:  impair or destroy natural resources or environmental qualities that are vital to the health and well-being of the present and future citizens of this State, or impair the viability of federal military facilities;


e. A cooperative planning process that involves the full participation of State, regional, county and local governments as well as representatives of federal military facilities and of other public and private sector interests will enhance prudent and rational development, redevelopment and conservation policies and the formulation of sound and consistent regional plans and planning criteria;


f. Since the overwhelming majority of New Jersey land use planning and development review occurs at the local level, it is important to provide local governments in this State with the technical resources and guidance necessary to assist them in developing land use plans and procedures which are based on sound planning information and practice, to assist local governments participating in a Department of Defense Joint Land Use Study, and to facilitate the development of local plans and Joint Land Use Studies which are consistent with State and regional plans and programs and the needs of nearby military facilities;


g. An increasing concentration of the poor and minorities in older urban areas jeopardizes the future well-being of this State, and a sound and comprehensive planning process will facilitate the provision of equal social and economic opportunity so that all of New Jersey's citizens can benefit from growth, development and redevelopment;


h. An adequate response to judicial mandates respecting housing for low- and moderate-income persons requires sound planning to prevent sprawl and to promote suitable use of land;  


i. Reductions in personnel and mission activities at military facilities have a direct, detrimental effect on this State.  The Department of Defense considers the encroachment of civilian development upon a military facility when determining the future viability of the facility.  Collaborative planning between military facility commanders and State, regional, county, and municipal officials can help protect an installation's military mission, as well as the public health, safety, quality of life, and economic stability of the civilian community;  and


j. These purposes can be best achieved through the establishment of a State planning commission consisting of representatives from the executive and legislative branches of State government, local government, the general public and the planning community.

a. It is in the public interest for New Jersey residents to have all appropriate personal health information available to them and to their treating health care professionals in a medical office, hospital emergency room, other health care facility setting, or pharmacy;


b. Natural disasters and other public health emergencies have demonstrated the need for timely, secure, and accessible health information, in particular for our most vulnerable populations, including senior citizens, persons with disabilities, and those with limited financial means;


c. Health information technology has great potential as one means of furthering progress towards achieving affordable, safe, and accessible health care for all persons by:  ensuring that health information is available at the point of care for all patients, while protecting the confidentiality and privacy of the information;  improving safety, reducing medical errors, and avoiding duplicative and unnecessary medical tests and procedures;  improving coordination of care among hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, home health agencies, pharmacies, and health care professionals;  and providing consumers with their own health information in order to encourage greater participation in decisions concerning their own health care;


d. The federal Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that health information technology, in addition to improving the quality of chronic care management and reducing medical errors, could achieve potential savings of almost 10% of total health care spending in the United States;


e. The many different and conflicting standards for collecting and reporting personal health information within the health care community currently hinder the appropriate sharing of patient health care information, and health information technology can eliminate these different standards;


f. State leadership can promote public policy, encourage coordinated efforts in the private health care sector, further public and private partnerships, and maximize federal and regional financial participation, in support of adopting an electronic health information infrastructure;


g. It is desirable to implement an electronic health information infrastructure in the context of a Statewide health information technology plan that includes standards and protocols designed to promote patient education, patient privacy, physician best practices, electronic connectivity to health care data, and generally a more efficient and less costly means of delivering quality health care in New Jersey, in order to provide for an interoperative environment among health care providers, health care payers, employers, and patients in New Jersey;


h. It is time for this State to clearly and unequivocally move its public policy in the direction of establishing an electronic health information infrastructure through a vehicle that provides for a collaborative planning and implementation strategy and includes the relevant public and private stakeholders in developing and achieving a sustainable model for an electronic health information network for New Jersey;  and


i. In order to conserve and efficiently use funds for the effective delivery of quality medical care to all persons, it is the policy of the State to lessen the expenditure of resources on unnecessarily repeated medical tests, while maintaining the highest quality of medical care for our citizens.

a. The Legislature finds and declares:

(1) There persist in the State and especially in the urban communities of New Jersey, areas of economic decay and declining housing stock and human deprivation, marked by the progressive deterioration of housing and community facilities and installations of the economic infrastructure.


(2) The dearth of employment opportunities for young persons in these areas has chronically exceeded any life problems experienced in other areas and under current economic conditions, has reached catastrophic proportions, particularly with respect to minority youth.


(3) The persistence of these problems despite the fact that the very youth thus affected present a vast and largely untapped resource of talent, energy and zeal sufficient to make a significant contribution to the revitalization of our urban and urbanized areas, suggests the need and desirability of establishing some mechanism to recruit, organize and direct the boundless energy and vigorous idealism of youth, so as to match their hitherto neglected potential against the currently intractable problems of urban reconstruction.

b. Accordingly, it is the purpose of the Legislature in enacting this act to establish a New Jersey Youth Corps to recruit, train and employ young persons to supplement and assist in preserving, conserving and enhancing those assets that are necessary to a sound and flourishing community life and are currently threatened by ongoing forces of urban decay.


c. Specifically, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is the intent of the Legislature that the New Jersey Youth Corps would be employed in such projects as the rehabilitation of substandard housing;  the repair, restoration and maintenance of public facilities and amenities;  assisting in the organization and delivery of educational and health and other social services required by various segments of urban populations.


d. It is the further intent of the Legislature that the New Jersey Youth Corps, in recruiting young persons for service therein, should aim primarily at providing socially worthwhile and reasonably remunerative employment to urban youth to whom these opportunities might not otherwise be available.


e. It is further intended by the Legislature that the proposed New Jersey Youth Corps be operated in a business like manner, with due regard to the true cost-effectiveness of such projects as it may engage in;  that its activities be coordinated with apprenticeship or other youth-oriented programs as may be concurrently conducted by State government, and that adequate departmental cooperation and liaison be established to secure that coordination;  and that its resources not be in any way employed in unfair price or wage competition with business or individuals.  Nothing in this act shall be construed as giving the administrator any authority by virtue of which the Youth Corps or any member or subdivision thereof may compete for any project on which an incorporated business or recognized labor union has expressed intention to bid.

“Small municipality” shall mean a municipality that has a limited population or geographic area according to criteria promulgated by the Director of the Division of Local Government Services in the Department of Community Affairs.


b. In developing and proposing a rule for adoption, the agency involved shall utilize approaches which will accomplish the objectives of applicable statutes while minimizing any adverse economic impact of the proposed rule on small municipalities.  Consistent with the objectives of applicable statutes, the agency shall utilize such approaches as:

(1) The establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small municipalities;


(2) The use of performance rather than design standards;  and


(3) An exemption from coverage by the rule, or by any part thereof, for small municipalities so long as the public health, safety, or general welfare is not endangered, or if an exemption is not a possibility, the use of alternative methods of implementing the requirements of the rule.

(2) A description of the reporting, record-keeping and other compliance requirements being proposed for adoption, and the kinds of professional services that a small municipality is likely to need in order to comply with the requirements;


(3) An estimate of the annual cost to a small municipality of complying with the rule;  and


(4) An indication of how the rule, as proposed for adoption, is designed to minimize any adverse economic impact of the proposed rule on small municipalities.

e. In order to avoid duplicative action, an agency may consider a series of closely related rules as one rule for the purposes of complying with the requirements of this section.


f. In complying with the provisions of this section, an agency may provide either a quantifiable or numerical description of the effects of a proposed rule or more general descriptive statements, if quantification is not practicable or reliable.

The criteria to govern a study to examine consolidation or the sharing of services shall include, but need not be limited to:

(1) a consideration of geographic factors, such as a shared boundary, or in the case of the recommended consolidation of more than two local units, that the consolidated local unit will have a contiguous boundary;


(2) an analysis of the economic costs and benefits of consolidation or the sharing of services, as the case may be, including potential tax savings and reductions in government costs through economies of scale;


(3) measures to ensure that costs and benefits of consolidation or service sharing are distributed equitably across the entire community;  and


(4) measures to safeguard the interests of communities in the municipalities for which consolidation is recommended.
The commission shall give priority to local units that volunteer to be studied.

New Jersey Statutes Title 58. Waters and Water Supply 58 § 22-2,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-58-waters-and-water-supply/nj-st-sect-58-22-2.html,"
(a) Adequate supplies of wholesome water are essential to the health, welfare, commerce and prosperity of the people of the State.  Such supplies will be best developed by long-range plans, to be put into effect in stages during a period of years.  The formulation and execution of such plans cannot safely be allowed to wait until the shortage of water in the State becomes critical in all parts of the State.


(b) The needs of the State's growing population and expanding industrial development require the establishment of new and additional water supply facilities;  the planning for and, subject to specific authorization by law, the acquisition of sites for the establishment of future water supply facilities;  and a continuing program of studies and investigations to determine the resources and potentials for development of the ground waters of the State.


(c) There is an immediate need for a new major supply of water to meet the present acute water requirements in the northeastern metropolitan counties and in the Raritan Valley, areas which directly and indirectly affect the commerce and prosperity of the entire State.


(d) The existing water sources in the Hackensack, Passaic, Rockaway, Wanaque and Pequannock rivers have been and are now being developed to the reasonable limit of the capacity of these rivers by municipalities and water companies in the northeastern region of New Jersey.  Well supplies in this region have also approached their limit of practicable development.


(e) Delaware Valley water supplies can ultimately be made available for New Jersey's long-range needs.  Such supplies are dependent on a comprehensive survey now being conducted by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, on a United States Supreme Court decision to establish the rights of the several States involved and on joint legislation of and co-operation between New Jersey and neighboring States.


(f) The Raritan river basin is the only area where large quantities of additional water can be obtained immediately and economically to serve the northeastern metropolitan counties as well as the counties in the Raritan Valley.  This basin is about equal in size to the Passaic river basin, is wholly within the State, is reasonably close to the counties needing water and is virtually undeveloped for water supply.


(g) The establishment of an on-river reservoir at Spruce Run will provide additional water supply from the Raritan river basin, provide a source of water to fill the reservoir at Round Valley, and provide increased and sustained minimum flows in the south branch downstream thereof and in the Raritan river.  The combined development of an off-river reservoir in the Round Valley area now under acquisition by the State for reservoir purposes with the smaller and cheaper on-river reservoir at Spruce Run will provide water supply storage for delivery of water in pipelines at the user's expense to areas within and without the Raritan river basin for areas desiring that type of supply as well as stream flow regulation for multiple use to serve areas, both within and without the basin, which prefer to obtain their supply at less initial cost from stream channels nearer to the area of demand.  Water from the reservoirs will also be available for local use.  The increased and sustained minimum flows will improve the quality of the water in the river, will tend to reduce the salinity in the tidal reaches, and will improve the upper river and its tributaries for recreational purposes.  Water for filling the reservoirs will not interfere with the higher sustained low flow specified by law and will not in any event adversely or otherwise affect the storage of water impounded in upstream lakes.


(h) The provisions proposed for the development of water storage facilities on the Raritan river basin are also applicable, with minor modifications, to the conservation and development of the ground-water resources of the South Jersey Coastal Plain and elsewhere in favorable areas throughout the State to provide storage and tide dam facilities to create artificial recharge of ground-water aquifers in areas of heavy pumpage and to protect such areas from surface pollution and salt water intrusion.  They also provide a basis for State participation in the long-range, authorization plan now under study by the United States Army Corps of Engineers for the development of the water resources of the interstate Delaware river basin.


(i) It is therefore in the interest of the health, safety and prosperity of the people of the State as a whole, that immediate legislative action be taken towards making provision for storage facilities to augment natural water resources to make available an adequate supply of water for the most critical need and in addition provide for a long-range program for development, as shall be required, of the remaining water resources of the State.

a. The current population of adults 60 years of age and older in New Jersey is about 1.4 million, and this number is expected to double in size over the next 25 years;


b. A primary objective of public policy governing access to long-term care in this State shall be to promote the independence, dignity and lifestyle choice of older adults and persons with physical disabilities or Alzheimer's disease and related disorders;


c. Many states are actively seeking to “rebalance” their long-term care programs and budgets in order to support consumer choice and offer more choices for older adults and persons with disabilities to live in their homes and communities;


d. New Jersey has been striving to redirect long-term care away from an over-reliance on institutional care toward more home and community-based options;  however, it is still often easier for older adults and persons with disabilities to qualify for Medicaid long-term care coverage if they are admitted to a nursing home than if they seek to obtain services through one of the Medicaid home and community-based long-term care options available in this State, such as the Global Options Waiver, Adult Day Health Services, Traumatic Brain Injury, AIDS Community Care Alternatives Program, Community Resources for People with Disabilities, or Community Resources for People with Disabilities Private Duty Nursing;  1


e. The federal “New Freedom Initiative” was launched in 2001 for the purpose of promoting the goal of independent living for persons with disabilities;  and 
Executive Order No. 13217
, issued by the President of the United States on June 18, 2001, called upon the federal government to assist states and localities to swiftly implement the 1999 United States Supreme Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C.  2 and directed federal agencies to evaluate their policies, programs, statutes, and regulations to determine whether any should be revised or modified to improve the availability of community-based services for qualified persons with disabilities;


f. Executive Order No. 100, issued by the Governor on March 23, 2004, directed the Commissioner of Health , in consultation with the State Treasurer, to prepare an analysis and recommendations for developing a global long-term care budgeting process designed to provide the Department of Health  with the authority and flexibility to move Medicaid recipients into the appropriate level of care based on their individual needs, and to identify specific gaps and requirements necessary to streamline paperwork and expedite the process of obtaining Medicaid eligibility for home care options for those who qualify;


g. Executive Order No. 31, issued by the Governor on April 21, 2005, established a “money follows the person” pilot program and set aside funding in fiscal year 2006 for home and community-based long-term care;


h. Older adults and those with physical disabilities or Alzheimer's disease and related disorders that require a nursing facility level of care should not be forced to choose between going into a nursing home or giving up the medical assistance that pays for their needed services, and thereby be denied the right to choose where they receive those services;  their eligibility for home and community-based long-term care services under Medicaid should be based upon the same income and asset standards as those used to determine eligibility for long-term care in an institutional setting;  and


i. The enactment of 
P.L.2006, c. 23
 (
C.30:4D-17.23 et seq.
) will ensure that, in the case of Medicaid-funded long-term care services, “the money follows the person” to allow maximum flexibility between nursing homes and home and community-based settings when it does not compromise federal funding or services in the nursing home and, in so doing, significantly expands the choices available to consumers of these services and thereby fulfills the goal of personal independence so highly valued by the growing number of older adults and persons with disabilities in this State.

New Jersey Statutes Title 13. Conservation and Development Parks and Reservations 13 § 8C-2,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-13-conservation-and-development-parks-and-reservations/nj-st-sect-13-8c-2.html,
New Jersey Statutes Title 13. Conservation and Development Parks and Reservations 13 § 8C-44,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-13-conservation-and-development-parks-and-reservations/nj-st-sect-13-8c-44.html,"
a. Enhancing the quality of life of the citizens of New Jersey is a paramount policy of the State, and the acquisition, preservation, and stewardship of open space, farmland, and historic properties in New Jersey protect and enhance the character and beauty of the State and provide its citizens with greater opportunities for recreation, relaxation, and education;


b. The lands and resources now dedicated to these purposes will not be adequate to meet the needs of an expanding population in years to come, and the open space and farmland that is available and appropriate for these purposes will gradually disappear as the costs of preserving them correspondingly increase;


c. The Delaware River, the Passaic River, and the Raritan River, and their respective tributaries, and many other areas throughout the State have been subject to serious flooding over the years, causing on some occasions loss of life and significant property damage;


d. Beginning on October 28, 2012, the post-tropical storm commonly referred to as “Hurricane Sandy” struck New Jersey, producing unprecedented severe weather conditions, including enormous storm surges, devastating wind, and widespread flooding, crippling entire communities across New Jersey, and inflicting incalculable harm to the economy of the State;


e. The acquisition of properties damaged by Hurricane Sandy and of other damaged and flood-prone properties throughout the State is in the best interests of the State to prevent future losses of life and property;


f. “Blue Acres” is the term used to refer to the acquisition, for recreation and conservation purposes, of lands that have been damaged by, or may be prone to incurring damage caused by, storms or storm-related flooding, or that may buffer or protect other lands from such damage;


g. Under the Blue Acres Program, structures on acquired property are demolished, the debris is removed, and the property is preserved for recreation and conservation purposes;


h. Agriculture plays an integral role in the prosperity and well-being of the State as well as providing a fresh and abundant supply of food for its citizens;


i. Much of the farmland in the State faces an imminent threat of permanent conversion to non-farm uses, and retention and development of an economically viable agricultural industry is of high public priority;


j. There is an urgent need to preserve the State's historic heritage to enable present and future generations to experience, understand, and enjoy the landmarks of New Jersey's role in the birth and development of this nation;


k. The restoration and preservation of properties of historic character and importance in the State are central to meeting this need, and a significant number of these historic properties are located in urban centers, where their restoration and preservation will advance urban revitalization efforts of the State and local governments;


l. There is growing public recognition that the quality of life, economic prosperity, and environmental quality in New Jersey are served by the protection and timely preservation of open space and farmland and better management of the lands, resources, historic properties, and recreational facilities that are already under public ownership or protection;


m. The protection and preservation of New Jersey's water resources, including the quality and quantity of the State's limited water supply, are essential to the quality of life and the economic health of the citizens of the State;


n. The preservation of the existing diversity of animal and plant species is essential to sustaining both the environment and the economy of the Garden State, and the conservation of adequate habitat for endangered, threatened, and other rare species is necessary to preserve this biodiversity;


o. As recognized by the voters of the State when they, on November 4, 2014, approved an amendment to the State Constitution to dedicate a portion of corporation business tax revenues specifically for the purposes of open space, farmland, and historic preservation, there is a need to continue the State open space, farmland, and historic preservation programs previously funded by the “Green Acres, Water Supply and Floodplain Protection, and Farmland and Historic Preservation Bond Act of 2009” (
P.L.2009, c. 117
), the “Green Acres, Farmland, Blue Acres, and Historic Preservation Bond Act of 2007” (
P.L.2007, c. 119
), 
Article VIII, Section II, paragraph 7 of the State Constitution
, the “Green Acres, Farmland and Historic Preservation, and Blue Acres Bond Act of 1995” (
P.L.1995, c. 204
), and the nine previous similar bond acts enacted in 1961, 1971, 1974, 1978, 1981, 1983, 1987, 1989, and 1992, and various implementing laws;  and


p. It is therefore in the public interest to preserve and protect as much land for recreation and conservation purposes, including lands that protect water supplies and flood-prone lands, and for farmland preservation purposes, and as many historic properties, as possible within the means provided by 
Article VIII, Section II, paragraph 6 of the State Constitution

a. Beginning with the proceeds received by the authority for the calendar year 1984 from the sale of bonds and for 24 years thereafter, the authority shall set aside $1,200,000.00 annually for the purpose of investing in obligations of the New Jersey Development Authority for Small Businesses, Minorities and Women's Enterprises established pursuant to P.L.1984, c.․․․․․․ (C. ․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․) (now pending before the Legislature as Assembly Committee Substitute for Assembly Bill No. 1828 of 1984). 1

For the purposes of this paragraph, “South Jersey” means the counties of Atlantic, Burlington, Camden, Cape May, Cumberland, Gloucester, Mercer, Ocean, and Salem;  and “North Jersey” means the remaining 12 counties of the State.  No more than 50% of the above amounts shall be made available to women, and no more than 50% of this amount shall be made available to minorities.



b. (1) The authority shall ensure that minority or women's businesses which are in the construction industry or related industries or services, including suppliers of materials and professional construction engineering and design services, shall receive at least 20% of the total expenditures on the total number of eligible projects financed each year by the authority.  A business shall be deemed to be a minority or women's business if it meets the definition of that term in section 2 of P.L.1984, c.․․․․․․ (C. ․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․․) (now pending before the Legislature as Assembly Committee Substitute for Assembly Bill No. 1828 of 1984).  The authority shall, in providing financing for eligible projects, impose such conditions as necessary to effectuate this 20% requirement.


(2) The primary obligation for carrying out the 20% minority and women's business set-aside rests with the borrowers of the proceeds of bonds of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority or the licensees, in the case of a direct investment.  Nothing contained herein, however, shall relieve the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority from the obligation of enforcing the requirement of the 20% set-aside for minority and women's businesses.  The borrower or licensee and those of its contractors which will make subcontracts with or purchase substantial supplies from or seek engineering or design services from other firms must seek out all available minority and women's businesses and make every effort to use as many of them as possible on the project, in order to satisfy the set-aside requirement.  A minority or women's business is available if the project is located in the market area of the minority or women's business and the minority or women's business can perform project services or supply project materials or provide engineering and design services at the time they are needed and at a competitive price.  The relevant market area depends on the kind of services or supplies which are needed.  The authority will require borrowers, licensees and prime contractors to engage minority and women's businesses from as wide a market area as is economically feasible.  A minority or women's business is qualified if it can perform the service or supply the materials that are needed.  Borrowers, licensees, and prime contractors will be expected to use minority and women's businesses with less experience than available nonminority enterprises and should expect to provide technical assistance to minority and women's businesses, as needed.  The authority may waive up to 10% of this 20% set-aside requirement, if the borrower of the proceeds of bonds of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority or the licensee, in the case of a direct investment, demonstrates at a public hearing of the authority that there are not sufficient, relevant, or qualified minority and women's business enterprises whose market areas include the project location to justify a waiver.  The borrower or licensee must detail in its waiver request the efforts the borrower or licensee and its potential contractors have exerted to locate and enlist minority and women's business enterprises.  The request must indicate the specific minority and women's business enterprises which were contacted and the reason each was not used.  Such a waiver request should ordinarily be made after the initial bidding or negotiation procedures prove unsuccessful;  however, a borrower or licensee whose eligible project is situated in an area where the minority population is very small may apply for a waiver before requesting bids on its project.  The Casino Reinvestment Development Authority shall only approve a waiver under exceptional circumstances.


(3) The authority may waive bonding requirements in full or in part in order to facilitate the use of such a business, if the business has been rejected by two surety companies authorized to do business in this State.  The authority may require a cash deposit, increase the amount of retention, or limit or eliminate periodic payments.  Such a waiver may not be extended more than three times.

a. There exists in certain municipalities a continuing state of fiscal distress which endures despite the imposition of a series of measures authorized pursuant to law;


b. Economically impoverished, those municipalities have a history of high crime rates, including arson, that has necessitated the maintenance of large police and fire departments, at enormous taxpayer cost in municipalities without a sound tax base;


c. The past fifty years have witnessed the depopulation of those municipalities characterized by such problems;


d. Spending power on the part of residents of these municipalities is severely limited and local businesses thereby suffer from the lack of an indigenous client base so that rebuilding the fortunes of city residents in order to recreate a viable urban economy will require a considerable period of time;


e. Notwithstanding the prosperity which has been experienced elsewhere throughout New Jersey in recent years, the unemployment rate in these municipalities is substantially higher than that of most other municipalities;


f. While the rest of New Jersey has enjoyed increased land values, the ratable base in these municipalities has declined steadily during the 1990's, marked by their low equalized value per capita which can be about one-half that of other cities;


g. Coupled with this economic deprivation, many of these municipalities are characterized by a lack of internal audit controls, accountability and oversight, evidenced by the fact that although real estate taxes comprise over two-thirds of locally generated revenues, many of these municipalities do not rigorously enforce collection and receive but a portion of their levy;


h. Although the State has experienced a period of tremendous prosperity and economic growth over the past few years, such municipalities continue to languish without any obvious signs of improvement;


i. These municipalities have experienced a substantial budget deficit for many years which has only been addressed through extraordinary payments of State aid;


j. While State aid dollars which have been directed toward such municipalities have served to address their structural deficits, they have not, and cannot, function as an economic impetus toward the rebuilding of those municipalities;


k. Because a significant proportion of the population of such municipalities lacks adequate health insurance coverage, causing many to seek basic care in municipal emergency rooms, municipal hospitals are heavily dependent upon State assistance commonly referred to as “charity care” for reimbursement.  Such health services are crucial to the overall health of the infrastructure and social growth and stability of qualified municipalities.  Moreover, the demand for such health services has necessitated planning for a major expansion of medical school programs within qualified municipalities;


l. Given the high crime rates in these municipalities, if economic recovery is to be successful, it is vital that municipal residents feel that their basic safety is assured;  accordingly, the State will continue to commit to assist such municipalities in maintaining not less than that number of police officers employed by the municipality at the time of the determination by the commissioner that the municipality fulfills the definition of a qualified municipality and in creating working relationships between State agencies, local law enforcement and the community to identify and develop strategies to improve the quality of life and the security of residents in qualified municipalities;


m. In order to ensure the long-term economic viability of such municipalities, it is critical that the Legislature encourage, to the extent possible, the production of market-rate housing within the municipality so as to expand the local tax base and provide a greater diversity of income levels among municipal inhabitants;


n. When faced with analogous situations, other states have employed extraordinary measures to provide leadership and oversight for struggling cities and the necessary tools to spur an economic revival within those cities;  and


o. In light of the dire needs faced by such municipalities and the lack of progress in addressing those needs either governmentally or through private sector initiative, and given the successful interventions on the part of other states in analogous circumstances, it is incumbent upon the State to take exceptional measures, on an interim basis, to rectify certain governance issues faced by such municipalities and to strategically invest those sums of money necessary in order to assure the long-term financial viability of these municipalities.

(2) In the case of an SDA district school facilities project, based upon its educational priority ranking and the Statewide strategic plan established pursuant to subsection m. of this section, the commissioner may authorize the development authority to undertake preconstruction activities which may include, but need not be limited to, site identification, investigation, and acquisition, feasibility studies, land-related design work, design work, site remediation, demolition, and acquisition of temporary facilities.  Upon receipt of the authorization, the development authority may initiate the preconstruction activities required to prepare the application for commissioner approval of the school facilities project.


e. The commissioner shall review each proposed school facilities project to determine whether it is consistent with the district's long-range facilities plan and whether it complies with the facilities efficiency standards and the area allowances per FTE student derived from those standards;  and in the case of an SDA district the commissioner shall also review the project's educational priority ranking and the Statewide strategic plan developed pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection m. of this section;  and in the case of a district other than an SDA district the commissioner shall also review the project's priority pursuant to paragraph (4) of subsection m. of this section.  The commissioner shall make a decision on a district's application within 90 days from the date he determines that the application is fully and accurately completed and that all information necessary for a decision has been filed by the district, or from the date of the last revision made by the district.  If the commissioner is not able to make a decision within 90 days, he shall notify the district in writing explaining the reason for the delay and indicating the date on which a decision on the project will be made, provided that the date shall not be later than 60 days from the expiration of the original 90 days set forth in this subsection.  If the decision is not made by the subsequent date indicated by the commissioner, then the project shall be deemed approved and the preliminary eligible costs for new construction shall be calculated by using the proposed square footage of the building as the approved area for unhoused students.


f. If the commissioner determines that the school facilities project complies with the facilities efficiency standards and the district's long-range facilities plan and does not exceed the area allowance per FTE student derived from those standards, the commissioner shall calculate the preliminary eligible costs of the project pursuant to the formulas set forth in section 7 of 
P.L.2000, c. 72
 (
C.18A:7G-7
);  except that (1) in the case of a county special services school district or a county vocational school district, the commissioner shall calculate the preliminary eligible costs to equal the amount determined by the board of school estimate and approved by the board of chosen freeholders pursuant to section 14 of P.L.1971, c. 271 (
C.18A:46-42
) or 
N.J.S.18A:54-31
 as appropriate, and (2) in the case of an SDA district, the commissioner shall calculate the preliminary eligible costs to equal the estimated cost as determined by the development authority.


g. If the commissioner determines that the school facilities project is inconsistent with the facilities efficiency standards or exceeds the area allowances per FTE student derived from those standards, the commissioner shall notify the district.

(1) The commissioner shall approve area allowances in excess of the area allowances per FTE student derived from the facilities efficiency standards if the board of education or State district superintendent, as appropriate, demonstrates that school facilities needs related to required programs cannot be addressed within the facilities efficiency standards and that all other proposed spaces are consistent with those standards.  The commissioner shall approve area allowances in excess of the area allowances per FTE student derived from the facilities efficiency standards if the additional area allowances are necessary to accommodate centralized facilities to be shared among two or more school buildings within the district and the centralized facilities represent a more cost effective alternative.


(2) The commissioner may waive a facilities efficiency standard if the board of education or State district superintendent, as appropriate, demonstrates to the commissioner's satisfaction that the waiver will not adversely affect the educational adequacy of the school facility, including the ability to deliver the programs and services necessary to enable all students to achieve the core curriculum content standards.


(3) To house the district's central administration, a district may request an adjustment to the approved areas for unhoused students of 2.17 square feet for each FTE student in the projected total district school enrollment if the proposed administrative offices will be housed in a school facility and the district demonstrates either that the existing central administrative offices are obsolete or that it is more practical to convert those offices to instructional space.  To the extent that existing administrative space will continue to be used for administrative purposes, the space shall be included in the formulas set forth in section 7 of 
P.L.2000, c. 72
 (
C.18A:7G-7
).
If the commissioner approves excess facilities efficiency standards or additional area allowances pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, the commissioner shall calculate the preliminary eligible costs based upon the additional area allowances or excess facilities efficiency standards pursuant to the formulas set forth in section 7 of 
P.L.2000, c. 72
 (
C.18A:7G-7
).  In the event that the commissioner does not approve the excess facilities efficiency standards or additional area allowances, the district may either:  modify its submission so that the school facilities project meets the facilities efficiency standards;  or pay for the excess costs.


(4) The commissioner shall approve spaces in excess of, or inconsistent with, the facilities efficiency standards, hereinafter referred to as nonconforming spaces, upon a determination by the district that the spaces are necessary to comply with State or federal law concerning individuals with disabilities, including that the spaces are necessary to provide in-district programs and services for current disabled pupils who are being served in out-of-district placements or in-district programs and services for the projected disabled pupil population.  A district may apply for additional State aid for nonconforming spaces that will permit pupils with disabilities to be educated to the greatest extent possible in the same buildings or classes with their nondisabled peers.  The nonconforming spaces may:  (a) allow for the return of pupils with disabilities from private facilities;  (b) permit the retention of pupils with disabilities who would otherwise be placed in private facilities;  (c) provide space for regional programs in a host school building that houses both disabled and nondisabled pupils;  and (d) provide space for the coordination of regional programs by a county special services school district, educational services commission, jointure commission, or other agency authorized by law to provide regional educational services in a school building that houses both disabled and nondisabled pupils.  A district's State support ratio shall be adjusted to equal the lesser of the sum of its district aid percentage as defined in section 3 of 
P.L.2000, c. 72
 (
C.18A:7G-3
) plus 0.25, or 100% for any nonconforming spaces approved by the commissioner pursuant to this paragraph.



(1) The commissioner shall approve area allowances in excess of the area allowances per FTE student derived from the facilities efficiency standards if the board of education or State district superintendent, as appropriate, demonstrates that school facilities needs related to required programs cannot be addressed within the facilities efficiency standards and that all other proposed spaces are consistent with those standards.  The commissioner shall approve area allowances in excess of the area allowances per FTE student derived from the facilities efficiency standards if the additional area allowances are necessary to accommodate centralized facilities to be shared among two or more school buildings within the district and the centralized facilities represent a more cost effective alternative.


(2) The commissioner may waive a facilities efficiency standard if the board of education or State district superintendent, as appropriate, demonstrates to the commissioner's satisfaction that the waiver will not adversely affect the educational adequacy of the school facility, including the ability to deliver the programs and services necessary to enable all students to achieve the core curriculum content standards.


(3) To house the district's central administration, a district may request an adjustment to the approved areas for unhoused students of 2.17 square feet for each FTE student in the projected total district school enrollment if the proposed administrative offices will be housed in a school facility and the district demonstrates either that the existing central administrative offices are obsolete or that it is more practical to convert those offices to instructional space.  To the extent that existing administrative space will continue to be used for administrative purposes, the space shall be included in the formulas set forth in section 7 of 
P.L.2000, c. 72
 (
C.18A:7G-7
).
If the commissioner approves excess facilities efficiency standards or additional area allowances pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, the commissioner shall calculate the preliminary eligible costs based upon the additional area allowances or excess facilities efficiency standards pursuant to the formulas set forth in section 7 of 
P.L.2000, c. 72
 (
C.18A:7G-7
).  In the event that the commissioner does not approve the excess facilities efficiency standards or additional area allowances, the district may either:  modify its submission so that the school facilities project meets the facilities efficiency standards;  or pay for the excess costs.


(4) The commissioner shall approve spaces in excess of, or inconsistent with, the facilities efficiency standards, hereinafter referred to as nonconforming spaces, upon a determination by the district that the spaces are necessary to comply with State or federal law concerning individuals with disabilities, including that the spaces are necessary to provide in-district programs and services for current disabled pupils who are being served in out-of-district placements or in-district programs and services for the projected disabled pupil population.  A district may apply for additional State aid for nonconforming spaces that will permit pupils with disabilities to be educated to the greatest extent possible in the same buildings or classes with their nondisabled peers.  The nonconforming spaces may:  (a) allow for the return of pupils with disabilities from private facilities;  (b) permit the retention of pupils with disabilities who would otherwise be placed in private facilities;  (c) provide space for regional programs in a host school building that houses both disabled and nondisabled pupils;  and (d) provide space for the coordination of regional programs by a county special services school district, educational services commission, jointure commission, or other agency authorized by law to provide regional educational services in a school building that houses both disabled and nondisabled pupils.  A district's State support ratio shall be adjusted to equal the lesser of the sum of its district aid percentage as defined in section 3 of 
P.L.2000, c. 72
 (
C.18A:7G-3
) plus 0.25, or 100% for any nonconforming spaces approved by the commissioner pursuant to this paragraph.


h. Upon approval of a school facilities project and determination of the preliminary eligible costs:

(1) In the case of a district other than an SDA district, the commissioner shall notify the district whether the school facilities project is approved and, if so approved, the preliminary eligible costs and the excess costs, if any.  Following the determination of preliminary eligible costs and the notification of project approval, the district may appeal to the commissioner for an increase in those costs if the detailed plans and specifications completed by a design professional for the school facilities project indicate that the cost of constructing that portion of the project which is consistent with the facilities efficiency standards and does not exceed the area allowances per FTE student exceeds the preliminary eligible costs as determined by the commissioner for the project by 10% or more.  The district shall file its appeal within 30 days of the preparation of the plans and specifications.  If the district chooses not to file an appeal, then the final eligible costs shall equal the preliminary eligible costs.
The appeal shall outline the reasons why the preliminary eligible costs calculated for the project are inadequate and estimate the amount of the adjustment which needs to be made to the preliminary eligible costs.  The commissioner shall forward the appeal information to the development authority for its review and recommendation.  If the additional costs are the result of factors that are within the control of the district or are the result of design factors that are not required to meet the facilities efficiency standards, the development authority shall recommend to the commissioner that the preliminary eligible costs be accepted as the final eligible costs.  If the development authority determines the additional costs are not within the control of the district or are the result of design factors required to meet the facilities efficiency standards, the development authority shall recommend to the commissioner a final eligible cost based on its experience for districts with similar characteristics, provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the commissioner shall not approve an adjustment to the preliminary eligible costs which exceeds 10% of the preliminary eligible costs.  The commissioner shall make a determination on the appeal within 30 days of its receipt.  If the commissioner does not approve an adjustment to the school facilities project's preliminary eligible costs, the commissioner shall issue his findings in writing on the reasons for the denial and on why the preliminary eligible costs as originally calculated are sufficient.


(2) In the case of an SDA district, the commissioner shall promptly prepare and submit to the development authority a preliminary project report which shall consist, at a minimum, of the following information:  a complete description of the school facilities project;  the actual location of the project;  the total square footage of the project together with a breakdown of total square footage by functional component;  the preliminary eligible costs of the project;  the project's priority ranking determined pursuant to subsection m. of this section;  any other factors to be considered by the development authority in undertaking the project;  and the name and address of the person from the district to contact in regard to the project.



(1) In the case of a district other than an SDA district, the commissioner shall notify the district whether the school facilities project is approved and, if so approved, the preliminary eligible costs and the excess costs, if any.  Following the determination of preliminary eligible costs and the notification of project approval, the district may appeal to the commissioner for an increase in those costs if the detailed plans and specifications completed by a design professional for the school facilities project indicate that the cost of constructing that portion of the project which is consistent with the facilities efficiency standards and does not exceed the area allowances per FTE student exceeds the preliminary eligible costs as determined by the commissioner for the project by 10% or more.  The district shall file its appeal within 30 days of the preparation of the plans and specifications.  If the district chooses not to file an appeal, then the final eligible costs shall equal the preliminary eligible costs.
The appeal shall outline the reasons why the preliminary eligible costs calculated for the project are inadequate and estimate the amount of the adjustment which needs to be made to the preliminary eligible costs.  The commissioner shall forward the appeal information to the development authority for its review and recommendation.  If the additional costs are the result of factors that are within the control of the district or are the result of design factors that are not required to meet the facilities efficiency standards, the development authority shall recommend to the commissioner that the preliminary eligible costs be accepted as the final eligible costs.  If the development authority determines the additional costs are not within the control of the district or are the result of design factors required to meet the facilities efficiency standards, the development authority shall recommend to the commissioner a final eligible cost based on its experience for districts with similar characteristics, provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the commissioner shall not approve an adjustment to the preliminary eligible costs which exceeds 10% of the preliminary eligible costs.  The commissioner shall make a determination on the appeal within 30 days of its receipt.  If the commissioner does not approve an adjustment to the school facilities project's preliminary eligible costs, the commissioner shall issue his findings in writing on the reasons for the denial and on why the preliminary eligible costs as originally calculated are sufficient.


(2) In the case of an SDA district, the commissioner shall promptly prepare and submit to the development authority a preliminary project report which shall consist, at a minimum, of the following information:  a complete description of the school facilities project;  the actual location of the project;  the total square footage of the project together with a breakdown of total square footage by functional component;  the preliminary eligible costs of the project;  the project's priority ranking determined pursuant to subsection m. of this section;  any other factors to be considered by the development authority in undertaking the project;  and the name and address of the person from the district to contact in regard to the project.


i. Upon receipt by the development authority of the preliminary project report, the development authority, upon consultation with the district, shall prepare detailed plans and specifications and schedules which contain the development authority's estimated cost and schedule to complete the school facilities project.  The development authority shall transmit to the commissioner its recommendations in regard to the project which shall, at a minimum, contain the detailed plans and specifications;  whether the school facilities project can be completed within the preliminary eligible costs;  and any other factors which the development authority determines should be considered by the commissioner.

(1) In the event that the development authority determines that the school facilities project can be completed within the preliminary eligible costs:  the final eligible costs shall be deemed to equal the preliminary eligible costs;  the commissioner shall be deemed to have given final approval to the project;  and the preliminary project report shall be deemed to be the final project report delivered to the development authority pursuant to subsection j. of this section.


(2) In the event that the development authority determines that the school facilities project cannot be completed within the preliminary eligible costs, prior to the submission of its recommendations to the commissioner, the development authority shall, in consultation with the district and the commissioner, determine whether changes can be made in the project which will result in a reduction in costs while at the same time meeting the facilities efficiency standards approved by the commissioner.

(a) If the development authority determines that changes in the school facilities project are possible so that the project can be accomplished within the scope of the preliminary eligible costs while still meeting the facilities efficiency standards, the development authority shall so advise the commissioner, whereupon the commissioner shall:  calculate the final eligible costs to equal the preliminary eligible costs;  give final approval to the project with the changes noted;  and issue a final project report to the development authority pursuant to subsection j. of this section.


(b) If the development authority determines that it is not possible to make changes in the school facilities project so that it can be completed within the preliminary eligible costs either because the additional costs are the result of factors outside the control of the district or the additional costs are required to meet the facilities efficiency standards, the development authority shall recommend to the commissioner that the preliminary eligible costs be increased accordingly, whereupon the commissioner shall:  calculate the final eligible costs to equal the sum of the preliminary eligible costs plus the increase recommended by the development authority;  give final approval to the project;  and issue a final project report to the development authority pursuant to subsection j. of this section.


(c) If the additional costs are the result of factors that are within the control of the district or are the result of design factors that are not required to meet the facilities efficiency standards or approved pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection g. of this section, the development authority shall recommend to the commissioner that the preliminary eligible costs be accepted, whereupon the commissioner shall:  calculate the final eligible costs to equal the preliminary eligible costs and specify the excess costs which are to be borne by the district;  give final approval to the school facilities project;  and issue a final project report to the development authority pursuant to subsection j. of this section;  provided that the commissioner may approve final eligible costs which are in excess of the preliminary eligible costs if, in his judgment, the action is necessary to meet the educational needs of the district.

e. In its discretion, place a limit, based on a percentage of existing housing stock in a municipality and any other criteria including employment opportunities which the council deems appropriate, upon the aggregate number of units which may be allocated to a municipality as its fair share of the region's present and prospective need for low and moderate income housing.  No municipality shall be required to address a fair share of housing units affordable to households with a gross household income of less than 80% of the median gross household income beyond 1,000 units within ten years from the grant of substantive certification, unless it is demonstrated, following objection by an interested party and an evidentiary hearing, based upon the facts and circumstances of the affected municipality that it is likely that the municipality through its zoning powers could create a realistic opportunity for more than 1,000 low and moderate income units within that ten-year period.  For the purposes of this section, the facts and circumstances which shall determine whether a municipality's fair share shall exceed 1,000 units, as provided above, shall be a finding that the municipality has issued more than 5,000 certificates of occupancy for residential units in the ten-year period preceding the petition for substantive certification in connection with which the objection was filed.
For the purpose of crediting low and moderate income housing units in order to arrive at a determination of present and prospective fair share, as set forth in paragraph (1) of subsection c. of this section, housing units comprised in a community residence for the developmentally disabled, as defined in section 2 of P.L.1977, c. 448 (
C.30:11B-2
), shall be fully credited pursuant to rules promulgated or to be promulgated by the council, to the extent that the units are affordable to persons of low and moderate income and are available to the general public.

The council, with respect to any municipality seeking substantive certification, shall require that a minimum percentage of housing units in any residential development resulting from a zoning change made to a previously non-residentially-zoned property, where the change in zoning precedes or follows the application for residential development by no more than 24 months, be reserved for occupancy by low or moderate income households, which percentage shall be determined by the council based on economic feasibility with consideration for the proposed density of development.

In carrying out the above duties, including, but not limited to, present and prospective need estimations the council shall give appropriate weight to pertinent research studies, government reports, decisions of other branches of government, implementation of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan prepared pursuant to sections 1 through 12 of P.L.1985, c. 398 (
C.52:18A-196 et seq.
) and public comment.  To assist the council, the State Planning Commission established under that act shall provide the council annually with economic growth, development and decline projections for each housing region for the next ten years.  The council shall develop procedures for periodically adjusting regional need based upon the low and moderate income housing that is provided in the region through any federal, State, municipal or private housing program.
No housing unit subject to the provisions of section 5 of 
P.L.2005, c. 350
 (
C.52:27D-123.15
) and to the provisions of the barrier free subcode adopted by the Commissioner of Community Affairs pursuant to the “State Uniform Construction Code Act,” P.L.1975, c. 217 (
C.52:27D-119 et seq.
) shall be eligible for inclusion in the municipal fair share plan certified by the council unless the unit complies with the requirements set forth thereunder.

a. The governing body of the county shall annually determine a sum sufficient to distribute among certain municipalities and the county according to the following formula:
A = CBS + CRS + LRS where:  A is the total tax pool to be distributed;  CBS is the county base share and is determined as .0000666 X the apportionment valuation of the county;  CRS is the county residual share and is determined as (A-CBS) x .60;  and LRS is the local residual share and is determined as (A-CBS) x .40.
The county base share (CBS) shall be appropriated to the county library which shall receive no funds from the library tax provided for in 
R.S.40:33-9
 or from the library tax established in P.L.1977, c. 300 (
C.40:33-15 et seq.
). The local residual share (LRS) shall be distributed among those municipalities not members of the county library system on January 1, 1982.  Each such municipality shall be apportioned an amount of those revenues in a proportion equal to the proportion which that municipality's apportionment valuation is of the apportionment valuation of all such municipalities.  Any municipality receiving revenues from the tax base sharing option provided in this section shall appropriate those funds directly to the board of trustees of any library within its borders funded by the municipality in the calendar year prior to the reorganization of the county library system.


b. For each year following the reorganization of the county library system, the county library distribution (CBS + CRS) from the formula established in subsection a. of this section shall not be less than the appropriation made to the county library in the calendar year immediately prior to the reorganization of the county library system;  provided, however, that in the first calendar year following the reorganization of the county library system, the county library shall receive an appropriation not less than an amount equal to the appropriation made to the county library in the calendar year preceding the reorganization of the system and not more than an amount equal to the prior year's appropriation plus 10% of that appropriation.
In each year following the reorganization of the county library system, the governing body of any municipality not a member of the county library system shall appropriate to any library in the municipality which was funded by the municipality prior to the reorganization of the county library system a sum of money not less than the average appropriation made to such libraries in the three years occurring immediately prior to the reorganization of the county library system.  The governing body shall also provide any in-kind benefits or the cash equivalent thereof, which were provided to such libraries during that preceding period.


c. The county library shall receive State aid as provided in the “State Library Aid Law” (
N.J.S.18A:74-1 et seq.
) based on expenditures from the total appropriation from the tax base sharing option made to the county library and the total resident population of the county.  Any library located within a municipality not a member of the county library system shall receive State aid as provided in the “State Library Aid Law” based on expenditures from the total appropriation made to the library from the municipality and from the portion of the local residual share received by the municipality as provided in subsection a. of this section.  Any municipality which is a member of the county library system and which supports a library shall receive State aid as provided in the “State Library Aid Law” based on the total appropriation made by the municipality for library purposes.


d. The county library shall make all of its patron services available to all residents of the county.  For the purpose of this act “patron services” means services rendered by a library directly to patrons as distinguished from those services rendered to other libraries.  Patron services shall include circulation of library materials, reference assistance, and public programs.


e. A municipality which maintains a municipal public library within the county shall not dissolve its municipal public library for a period of two calendar years from the effective date of the reorganization of the county library system.


f. The county library commission may offer a service contract for library services to any municipality within the county for any library services performed by the county library.  Any such contracts shall conform to the contracts established in section 7 of this act.  2


g. The county library study commission shall remain in existence for one calendar year after the effective date of such reorganization.  It shall be the responsibility of the commission to evaluate the tax base sharing option and to determine if the appropriation for the county library system is sufficient to provide patron services to all residents of the county and that such services are in compliance with standards promulgated by the  State Library for such libraries.  The commission shall make a report of its findings to the county governing body within one calendar year of the reorganization of the county library system.

Such persons shall not be given credit for pension purposes hereunder for any prior service;  provided, however, that where any such employee has had prior service as an employee in any State, county or municipal position, such employees shall be given credit for pension purposes hereunder for such prior service upon written application therefor to the pension commission within 1 year after becoming a member of this retirement system and upon payment into the retirement system herein provided, for a period of time equal to the length of prior service for which credit is allowed, of a sum of money equal in amount to 6% of salary, said 6% of salary being based upon the salary received by such employee at the time of the making of said application.  Said sum of money may be paid in one lump sum or by semimonthly deductions from salary, whichever method the applicant may elect, together with the regular deductions provided by this act, until completed;  provided, however, that such prior service shall be credited only as paid for.   All payments aforesaid by the employee shall be made together with interest thereon at a rate to be determined by the pension commission.

(1) an estimate of the anticipated liability of the affected retirement systems;

e. In order to make the calculation required by paragraph (2) of subsection d. of this section, the Director of the Division of Pensions and Benefits in the Department of the Treasury shall submit the proposed incentive program to the actuary of each retirement system which would be affected by the incentive program.  Each actuary shall estimate the additional liability to the retirement system for the incentive program, including the liability for the additional service credit and the earlier retirement of employees under the incentive program.  Each actuary shall provide the Director of the Division of Pensions and Benefits with an opinion on whether the incentive program is reasonably calculated to produce a reduction in the number of employees of the municipality providing the affected governmental services, and a net savings, taking into consideration the liability for the incentive program, in the employment costs to provide the affected governmental services.  The State shall conduct the actuarial work required by this subsection at no charge to the municipality.


f. If the incentive program includes the provision of additional service credit under State retirement systems for eligible employees, the beginning and ending dates for the incentive program and the time period during which the eligible employees will have to elect to participate in the incentive program shall be subject to approval by the Director of the Division of Pensions and Benefits in the Department of the Treasury.


g. If the director determines that the incentive program will result in the municipality continuing to provide the affected governmental services with fewer employees and at a lower cost, and that the incentive program will result in net savings and will not necessitate any increase in local property taxes for the municipality, the director shall approve the incentive program for implementation.


h. For employees who are members of the Police and Firemen's Retirement System of New Jersey, pursuant to P.L.1944, c. 255 (
C.43:16A-1 et seq.
), an incentive program for retirement may provide additional months of service credit for an employee who has 20 or more years of service credit on the last day for retirement under the incentive program, so that the employee shall have an aggregate amount of service credit under the retirement system of no more than 30 years on the effective date of retirement.  In no case shall more than 60 months of additional service credit be provided under the incentive program.


i. For employees who are members of the Public Employees' Retirement System of New Jersey, pursuant to P.L.1954, c. 84 (
C.43:15A-1 et seq.
), or a municipal retirement system, an incentive program for retirement may provide not more than 60 additional months of service credit for an employee who has 20 or more years of service credit on the last day for retirement under the incentive program.


j. An incentive program may require one or more of the following criteria:  a minimum number of years of service credit in a retirement system, a minimum number of years of service with the municipality, or a minimum age for eligibility to participate in the program.


k. An employee who receives an incentive benefit for retirement or termination of employment under this section shall forfeit any tenure, civil service, or other employment right for continued employment or for return to employment based upon the employment for which the employee receives the incentive benefit.


l. When the needs of the municipality require the continuation in service of an employee who elects to retire and receive an incentive benefit under this section, the effective retirement date of the employee may be delayed, with the approval of the governing body of the municipality and the agreement of the employee, until the first day of any month not later than the twelfth month after the last date for retirement under the incentive program.  If an employee whose retirement is delayed under this subsection dies before the retirement becomes effective, the retirement shall be effective on the first day of the month after the date of death of the employee, unless the employee's beneficiary for retirement benefits requests in writing to the board of trustees of the retirement system that benefits payable for death in active service be paid on behalf of the employee.


m. An employee retiring with an incentive benefit under this section who has not paid the full amount of a loan from the retirement system by the effective date of retirement may repay the loan through deductions from the monthly retirement benefits in the same monthly amount which was deducted from the member's compensation immediately preceding retirement, until the balance of the amount borrowed with interest at the statutory rate is repaid.  If the retiree dies before the outstanding balance of the loan and interest is repaid, the remaining balance shall be repaid as provided in the laws governing the retirement system for repayment of loans.


n. Notwithstanding the provisions of the laws governing the retirement system, an employee purchasing service credit to qualify for a benefit under this section may, for each affected retirement system, purchase a portion of the service credit which the employee is eligible to purchase.


o. If the incentive program is approved and implemented, the actuary to the affected retirement system shall determine the full amount of the liability of the retirement system for the incentive program including the liability for the additional service credit and the earlier retirement of employees under the incentive program in accordance with the assumptions used by the retirement system to determine the full liabilities of the system.  The municipality shall pay the amount of the liability determined by the actuary to the retirement system in a lump sum or through annual installment payments without interest, for a period approved by the Director of the Division of Pensions and Benefits in the Department of the Treasury which shall not exceed 10 years.  The municipality shall pay the cost for the actuarial work to determine the full liability of the retirement system if the incentive program is approved and implemented.  If the municipality does not make payments for the liability, the cost of the actuarial work, and administrative expenses in a timely manner, the municipality shall be subject to interest and penalties on the payments on the same basis provided for late payment of employer contributions to the retirement system under the laws and rules governing the retirement system.


p. The Director of the Division of Pensions and Benefits in the Department of the Treasury shall provide the municipality with information on the estimated liability for the proposed incentive program, and actual liability if the program is approved and implemented.  If the program provides additional service credit to employees under the Public Employees' Retirement System of New Jersey, pursuant to P.L.1954, c. 84 (
C.43:15A-1 et seq.
), or the Police and Firemen's Retirement System of New Jersey, pursuant to P.L.1944, c. 255 (
C.43:16A-1 et seq.
), the director shall provide the eligible employees of the municipality with information on the benefits they would receive under the incentive program, and other appropriate assistance, to enable employees to decide whether to accept the incentive benefit and retire from the retirement systems if they accept the incentive benefit.


q. The powers, duties, and responsibilities related to retirement systems under this section for municipal retirement systems shall be exercised and performed by the governing bodies of the retirement systems.


r. Prior to the beginning date of the incentive program, appropriate representatives of the governing body of the municipality which implements an incentive program pursuant to this section shall meet and consult with the majority representative of the bargaining unit or units which include the employees of the municipality who would be eligible for the incentive program.


s. For a period of five years after the last date for retirement or termination of employment under an incentive program implemented pursuant to this section, the employment level of the municipality for the provision of governmental services previously performed by employees that participated in the incentive program shall not, without the approval of the director, exceed the employment level specified in the incentive program approved by the director.  The director may approve an increase in the employment level to provide the affected governmental services if the director determines that:

(1) changes in local conditions such as increased residential or commercial development, increased population, or other changes, have created an increased need or demand for the affected governmental services;  and


(2) an increase in the employment level for the affected governmental services is warranted and will provide for the delivery of governmental services in an effective and cost efficient manner.  The municipality shall submit annual reports to the director for five years after the last date for retirement or termination of employment under an incentive program implemented pursuant to this section, in the form and manner required by the director, concerning the number of employees and the employment costs to provide the affected governmental services.

New Jersey Statutes Title 58. Waters and Water Supply 58 § 10B-12,https://codes.findlaw.com/nj/title-58-waters-and-water-supply/nj-st-sect-58-10b-12.html,"
a. The Department of Environmental Protection shall adopt minimum remediation standards for soil, groundwater, and surface water quality necessary for the remediation of contamination of real property.  The remediation standards shall be developed to ensure that the potential for harm to public health and safety and to the environment is minimized to acceptable levels, taking into consideration the location, the surroundings, the intended use of the property, the potential exposure to the discharge, and the surrounding ambient conditions, whether naturally occurring or man-made.
Until the minimum remediation standards for the protection of public health and safety as described herein are adopted, the department shall apply public health and safety remediation standards for contamination at a site on a case-by-case basis based upon the considerations and criteria enumerated in this section.



The department may not require any person to perform an ecological evaluation of any area of concern that consists of an underground storage tank storing heating oil for on-site consumption in a one to four family residential building.


b. In developing minimum remediation standards the department shall:

(1) base the standards on generally accepted and peer reviewed scientific evidence or methodologies;


(2) base the standards upon reasonable assumptions of exposure scenarios as to amounts of contaminants to which humans or other receptors will be exposed, when and where those exposures will occur, and the amount of that exposure;


(3) avoid the use of redundant conservative assumptions.  The department shall avoid the use of redundant conservative assumptions by the use of parameters that provide an adequate margin of safety and which avoid the use of unrealistic conservative exposure parameters and which guidelines make use of the guidance and regulations for exposure assessment developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the “Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980,” 
42 U.S.C. s.9601 et seq.
 and other statutory authorities as applicable;


(4) where feasible, establish the remediation standards as numeric or narrative standards setting forth acceptable levels or concentrations for particular contaminants;  and


(5) consider and utilize, in the absence of other standards used or developed by the Department of Environmental Protection and the United States Environmental Protection Agency, the toxicity factors, slope factors for carcinogens and reference doses for non-carcinogens from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS).

c. (1) The department shall develop residential and nonresidential soil remediation standards that are protective of public health and safety.  For contaminants that are mobile and transportable to groundwater or surface water, the residential and nonresidential soil remediation standards shall be protective of groundwater and surface water.  Residential soil remediation standards shall be set at levels or concentrations of contamination for real property based upon the use of that property for residential or similar uses and which will allow the unrestricted use of that property without the need of engineering devices or any institutional controls and without exceeding a health risk standard greater than that provided in subsection d. of this section.  Nonresidential soil remediation standards shall be set at levels or concentrations of contaminants that recognize the lower likelihood of exposure to contamination on property that will not be used for residential or similar uses, which will allow for the unrestricted use of that property for nonresidential purposes, and that can be met without the need of engineering controls.  Whenever real property is remediated to a nonresidential soil remediation standard, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3) of subsection g. of this section, the department shall require, pursuant to section 36 of 
P.L.1993, c. 139
 (
C.58:10B-13
), that the use of the property be restricted to nonresidential or other uses compatible with the extent of the contamination of the soil and that access to that site be restricted in a manner compatible with the allowable use of that property.


(2) The department may develop differential remediation standards for surface water or groundwater that take into account the current, planned, or potential use of that water in accordance with the “Clean Water Act” (
33 U.S.C. s.1251 et seq.
) and the “Water Pollution Control Act,” P.L.1977, c. 74 (
C.58:10A-1 et seq.
).

P.L.1993, c. 139
 (
C.58:10B-13
), that the use of the property be restricted to nonresidential or other uses compatible with the extent of the contamination of the soil and that access to that site be restricted in a manner compatible with the allowable use of that property.

33 U.S.C. s.1251 et seq.
) and the “Water Pollution Control Act,” P.L.1977, c. 74 (
C.58:10A-1 et seq.
).


d. The department shall develop minimum remediation standards for soil, groundwater, and surface water intended to be protective of public health and safety taking into account the provisions of this section.  In developing these minimum health risk remediation standards the department shall identify the hazards posed by a contaminant to determine whether exposure to that contaminant can cause an increase in the incidence of an adverse health effect and whether the adverse health effect may occur in humans.  The department shall set minimum soil remediation health risk standards for both residential and nonresidential uses that:

(1) for human carcinogens, as categorized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, will result in an additional cancer risk of one in one million;


(2) for noncarcinogens, will limit the Hazard Index for any given effect to a value not exceeding one.
The health risk standards established in this subsection are for any particular contaminant and not for the cumulative effects of more than one contaminant at a site.

(2) for noncarcinogens, will limit the Hazard Index for any given effect to a value not exceeding one.
The health risk standards established in this subsection are for any particular contaminant and not for the cumulative effects of more than one contaminant at a site.


e. Remediation standards and other remediation requirements established pursuant to this section and regulations adopted pursuant thereto shall apply to remediation activities required pursuant to the “Spill Compensation and Control Act,” P.L.1976, c. 141 (
C.58:10-23.11 et seq.
), the “Water Pollution Control Act,” P.L.1977, c. 74 (
C.58:10A-1 et seq.
), P.L.1986, c. 102 (
C.58:10A-21 et seq.
), the “Industrial Site Recovery Act,” P.L.1983, c. 330 (
C.13:1K-6
 et al.), the “Solid Waste Management Act,” P.L.1970, c. 39 (
C.13:1E-1 et seq.
), the “Comprehensive Regulated Medical Waste Management Act,” sections 1 through 25 of 
P.L.1989, c. 34
 (
C.13:1E-48.1 et seq.
), the “Major Hazardous Waste Facilities Siting Act,” P.L.1981, c. 279 (
C.13:1E-49 et seq.
), the “Sanitary Landfill Facility Closure and Contingency Fund Act,” P.L.1981, c. 306 (
C.13:1E-100 et seq.
), the “Regional Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Facility Siting Act,” P.L.1987, c. 333 (
C.13:1E-177 et seq.
), or any other law or regulation by which the State may compel a person to perform remediation activities on contaminated property.  However, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of the department to establish discharge limits for pollutants or to prescribe penalties for violations of those limits pursuant to P.L.1977, c. 74 (
C.58:10A-1 et seq.
), or to require the complete removal of nonhazardous solid waste pursuant to law.



f. (1) A person performing a remediation of contaminated real property, in lieu of using the established minimum soil remediation standard for either residential use or nonresidential use adopted by the department pursuant to subsection c. of this section, may submit to the department a request to use an alternative residential use or nonresidential use soil remediation standard.  The use of an alternative soil remediation standard shall be based upon site specific factors which may include (1) physical site characteristics which may vary from those used by the department in the development of the soil remediation standards adopted pursuant to this section;  or (2) a site specific risk assessment.  If a person performing a remediation requests to use an alternative soil remediation standard based upon a site specific risk assessment, that person shall demonstrate to the department that the requested deviation from the risk assessment protocol used by the department in the development of soil remediation standards pursuant to this section is consistent with the guidance and regulations for exposure assessment developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the “Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980,” 
42 U.S.C. s.9601 et seq.
 and other statutory authorities as applicable.  A site specific risk assessment may consider exposure scenarios and assumptions that take into account the form of the contaminant present, natural biodegradation, fate and transport of the contaminant, available toxicological data that are based upon generally accepted and peer reviewed scientific evidence or methodologies, and physical characteristics of the site, including, but not limited to, climatic conditions and topographic conditions.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the use of an alternative soil remediation standard in those instances where an engineering control is the appropriate remedial action, as determined by the department, to prevent exposure to contamination.

Upon a determination by the department that the requested alternative remediation standard satisfies the department's regulations, is protective of public health and safety, as established in subsection d. of this section, and is protective of the environment pursuant to subsection a. of this section, the alternative residential use or nonresidential use soil remediation standard shall be approved by the department.  The burden to demonstrate that the requested alternative remediation standard is protective rests with the person requesting the alternative standard and the department may require the submission of any documentation as the department determines to be necessary in order for the person to meet that burden.

(2) The department may, upon its own initiative, require an alternative remediation standard for a particular contaminant for a specific real property site, in lieu of using the established minimum residential use or nonresidential use soil remediation standard adopted by the department for a particular contaminant pursuant to this section.  The department may require an alternative remediation standard pursuant to this paragraph upon a determination by the department, based on the weight of the scientific evidence, that due to specific physical site characteristics of the subject real property, including, but not limited to, its proximity to surface water, the use of the adopted residential use or nonresidential use soil remediation standards would not be protective, or would be unnecessarily overprotective, of public health or safety or of the environment, as appropriate.



f. (1) A person performing a remediation of contaminated real property, in lieu of using the established minimum soil remediation standard for either residential use or nonresidential use adopted by the department pursuant to subsection c. of this section, may submit to the department a request to use an alternative residential use or nonresidential use soil remediation standard.  The use of an alternative soil remediation standard shall be based upon site specific factors which may include (1) physical site characteristics which may vary from those used by the department in the development of the soil remediation standards adopted pursuant to this section;  or (2) a site specific risk assessment.  If a person performing a remediation requests to use an alternative soil remediation standard based upon a site specific risk assessment, that person shall demonstrate to the department that the requested deviation from the risk assessment protocol used by the department in the development of soil remediation standards pursuant to this section is consistent with the guidance and regulations for exposure assessment developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to the “Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980,” 
42 U.S.C. s.9601 et seq.
 and other statutory authorities as applicable.  A site specific risk assessment may consider exposure scenarios and assumptions that take into account the form of the contaminant present, natural biodegradation, fate and transport of the contaminant, available toxicological data that are based upon generally accepted and peer reviewed scientific evidence or methodologies, and physical characteristics of the site, including, but not limited to, climatic conditions and topographic conditions.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the use of an alternative soil remediation standard in those instances where an engineering control is the appropriate remedial action, as determined by the department, to prevent exposure to contamination.


(2) The department may, upon its own initiative, require an alternative remediation standard for a particular contaminant for a specific real property site, in lieu of using the established minimum residential use or nonresidential use soil remediation standard adopted by the department for a particular contaminant pursuant to this section.  The department may require an alternative remediation standard pursuant to this paragraph upon a determination by the department, based on the weight of the scientific evidence, that due to specific physical site characteristics of the subject real property, including, but not limited to, its proximity to surface water, the use of the adopted residential use or nonresidential use soil remediation standards would not be protective, or would be unnecessarily overprotective, of public health or safety or of the environment, as appropriate.


g. The development, selection, and implementation of any remediation standard or remedial action shall ensure that it is protective of public health, safety, and the environment, as applicable, as provided in this section.  In determining the appropriate remediation standard or remedial action that shall occur at a site, the department and any person performing the remediation, shall base the decision on the following factors:

(1) Unrestricted use remedial actions, limited restricted use remedial actions and restricted use remedial actions shall be allowed except that unrestricted use remedial actions and limited restricted use remedial actions shall be preferred over restricted use remedial actions.  For any remediation initiated one year after the date of enactment of 
P.L.2009, c. 60
 (
C.58:10C-1
 et al.), the department shall require the use of an unrestricted use remedial action, or a presumptive remedy or an alternative remedy as provided in paragraph (10) of this subsection, at a site or area of concern where new construction is proposed for residential purposes, for use as a child care center licensed pursuant to P.L.1983, c. 492 (
C.30:5B-1 et seq.
), or as a public school or private school as defined in 
N.J.S.18A:1-1
, as a charter school established pursuant to 
P.L.1995, c. 426
 (
C.18A:36A-1 et seq.
), or where there will be a change in the use of the site to residential, child care, or public school, private school, or charter school purposes or another purpose that involves use by a sensitive population.  For any remediation initiated on or after the date of enactment of 
P.L.2009, c. 60
 (
C.58:10C-1
 et al.), the department may require the use of an unrestricted use remedial action or a presumptive remedy as provided in guidelines adopted pursuant to paragraph (10) of this subsection for a site or area of concern that is to be used for residential, child care, or public school, private school, or charter school purposes or another purpose that involves use by a sensitive population.  Except as provided in this subsection, and section 27 of 
P.L.2009, c. 60
 (
C.58:10C-27
), the department, however, may not disapprove the use of a restricted use remedial action or a limited restricted use remedial action so long as the selected remedial action meets the health risk standard established in subsection d. of this section, and where, as applicable, is protective of the environment.  Except as provided in this subsection and section 27 of 
P.L.2009, c. 60
 (
C.58:10C-27
), the choice of the remedial action to be implemented shall be made by the person responsible for conducting the remediation in accordance with regulations adopted by the department and that choice of the remedial action shall be approved by the department if all the criteria for remedial action selection enumerated in this section, as applicable, are met.  Except as provided in section 27 of 
P.L.2009, c. 60
 (
C.58:10C-27
), the department may not require a person to compare or investigate any alternative remedial action as part of its review of the selected remedial action.  The department may disapprove the selection of a remedial action for a site on which the proposed remedial action will render the property unusable for future redevelopment or for recreational use;


(2) Contamination may, upon the department's approval, be left onsite at levels or concentrations that exceed the minimum soil remediation standards for residential use if the implementation of institutional or engineering controls at that site will result in the protection of public health, safety and the environment at the health risk standard established in subsection d. of this section, if the requirements established in subsections a., b., c. and d. of section 36 of 
P.L.1993, c. 139
 (
C.58:10B-13
), and paragraphs (1) and (10) of this subsection, are met.  The department may also require the treatment or removal of contaminated material that would pose an acute health or safety hazard in the event of failure of an engineering control;


(3) Real property on which there is soil that has not been remediated to the residential soil remediation standards, or real property on which the soil, groundwater, or surface water has been remediated to meet the required health risk standard by the use of engineering or institutional controls, may be developed or used for residential purposes, or for any other similar purpose, if (a) all areas of that real property at which a person may come into contact with soil are remediated to meet the residential soil remediation standards, (b) it is clearly demonstrated that for all areas of the real property, other than those described in subparagraph (a) above, engineering and institutional controls can be implemented and maintained on the real property sufficient to meet the health risk standard as established in subsection d. of this section, and (c) a presumptive remedy established and approved by the department pursuant to paragraph (10) of this subsection, or an alternative remedy approved by the department pursuant to paragraph (10) of this subsection, has been approved, as provided in paragraphs (1) and (10) of this subsection;


(4) Remediation shall not be required beyond the regional natural background levels for any particular contaminant.  The department shall develop regulations that set forth a process to identify background levels of contaminants for a particular region.  For the purpose of this paragraph “regional natural background levels” means the concentration of a contaminant consistently present in the environment of the region of the site and which has not been influenced by localized human activities;


(5) Remediation shall not be required of the owner or operator of real property for contamination coming onto the site from another property owned and operated by another person, unless the owner or operator is the person who is liable for cleanup and removal costs pursuant to P.L.1976, c. 141 (
C.58:10-23.11 et seq.
);


(6) Groundwater that is contaminated shall not be required to be remediated to a level or concentration for any particular contaminant lower than the level or concentration that is migrating onto the property from another property owned and operated by another person;


(7) The technical performance, effectiveness and reliability of the proposed remedial action in attaining and maintaining compliance with applicable remediation standards and required health risk standards shall be considered.  In reviewing a proposed remedial action, the department or the licensed site remediation professional shall also consider the ability of the owner or operator to implement the proposed remedial action within a reasonable time frame without jeopardizing public health, safety or the environment;


(8) The use of a remedial action for soil contamination that is determined by the department to be effective in its guidance document created pursuant to section 38 of 
P.L.1993, c. 139
 (
C.58:10B-14
), is presumed to be an appropriate remedial action if it is to be implemented on a site in the manner described by the department in the guidance document and applicable regulations and if all of the conditions for remedy selection provided for in this section are met.  The burden to prove compliance with the criteria in the guidance document is with the person responsible for conducting the remediation;


(9) (Deleted by amendment, 
P.L.1997, c. 278
);


(10) The department shall, by rule or regulation, establish presumptive remedies, use of which shall be required on any site or area of concern to be used for residential purposes, as a child care center licensed pursuant to P.L.1983, c. 492 (
C.30:5B-1 et seq.
), as a public school or private school as defined in 
N.J.S.18A:1-1
, or as a charter school established pursuant to 
P.L.1995, c. 426
 (
C.18A:36A-1 et seq.
).  The department may also issue guidelines that provide for presumptive remedies that may be required as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, on a site to be used for residential purposes, as a child care center, or as a public school, private school or charter school.  The presumptive remedies shall be based on the historic use of the property, the nature and extent of the contamination at the site, the future use of the site and any other factors deemed relevant by the department.  The department may include the use of engineering and institutional controls in the presumptive remedies authorized pursuant to this subsection.  If the person responsible for conducting the remediation demonstrates to the department that the use of an unrestricted use remedial action or a presumptive remedy is impractical due to conditions at the site, or that an alternative remedy would be equally protective over time as a presumptive remedy, then an alternative remedy for the site that is protective of the public health and safety may be proposed for review and approval by the department;


(11) The department may authorize a person conducting a remediation to divide a contaminated site into one or more areas of concern.  For each area of concern, a different remedial action may be selected provided the requirements of this subsection are met and the remedial action selected is consistent with the future use of the property;  and


(12) The construction of single family residences, public schools, private schools, or charter schools, or child care centers shall be prohibited on a landfill that undergoes a remediation if engineering controls are required for the management of landfill gas or leachate.
The burden to demonstrate that a remedial action is protective of public health, safety and the environment, as applicable, and has been selected in conformance with the provisions of this subsection is with the person responsible for conducting the remediation.
The department may require the person responsible for conducting the remediation to supply the information required pursuant to this subsection as is necessary for the department to make a determination.



(1) Unrestricted use remedial actions, limited restricted use remedial actions and restricted use remedial actions shall be allowed except that unrestricted use remedial actions and limited restricted use remedial actions shall be preferred over restricted use remedial actions.  For any remediation initiated one year after the date of enactment of 
P.L.2009, c. 60
 (
C.58:10C-1
 et al.), the department shall require the use of an unrestricted use remedial action, or a presumptive remedy or an alternative remedy as provided in paragraph (10) of this subsection, at a site or area of concern where new construction is proposed for residential purposes, for use as a child care center licensed pursuant to P.L.1983, c. 492 (
C.30:5B-1 et seq.
), or as a public school or private school as defined in 
N.J.S.18A:1-1
, as a charter school established pursuant to 
P.L.1995, c. 426
 (
C.18A:36A-1 et seq.
), or where there will be a change in the use of the site to residential, child care, or public school, private school, or charter school purposes or another purpose that involves use by a sensitive population.  For any remediation initiated on or after the date of enactment of 
P.L.2009, c. 60
 (
C.58:10C-1
 et al.), the department may require the use of an unrestricted use remedial action or a presumptive remedy as provided in guidelines adopted pursuant to paragraph (10) of this subsection for a site or area of concern that is to be used for residential, child care, or public school, private school, or charter school purposes or another purpose that involves use by a sensitive population.  Except as provided in this subsection, and section 27 of 
P.L.2009, c. 60
 (
C.58:10C-27
), the department, however, may not disapprove the use of a restricted use remedial action or a limited restricted use remedial action so long as the selected remedial action meets the health risk standard established in subsection d. of this section, and where, as applicable, is protective of the environment.  Except as provided in this subsection and section 27 of 
P.L.2009, c. 60
 (
C.58:10C-27
), the choice of the remedial action to be implemented shall be made by the person responsible for conducting the remediation in accordance with regulations adopted by the department and that choice of the remedial action shall be approved by the department if all the criteria for remedial action selection enumerated in this section, as applicable, are met.  Except as provided in section 27 of 
P.L.2009, c. 60
 (
C.58:10C-27
), the department may not require a person to compare or investigate any alternative remedial action as part of its review of the selected remedial action.  The department may disapprove the selection of a remedial action for a site on which the proposed remedial action will render the property unusable for future redevelopment or for recreational use;


(2) Contamination may, upon the department's approval, be left onsite at levels or concentrations that exceed the minimum soil remediation standards for residential use if the implementation of institutional or engineering controls at that site will result in the protection of public health, safety and the environment at the health risk standard established in subsection d. of this section, if the requirements established in subsections a., b., c. and d. of section 36 of 
P.L.1993, c. 139
 (
C.58:10B-13
), and paragraphs (1) and (10) of this subsection, are met.  The department may also require the treatment or removal of contaminated material that would pose an acute health or safety hazard in the event of failure of an engineering control;


(3) Real property on which there is soil that has not been remediated to the residential soil remediation standards, or real property on which the soil, groundwater, or surface water has been remediated to meet the required health risk standard by the use of engineering or institutional controls, may be developed or used for residential purposes, or for any other similar purpose, if (a) all areas of that real property at which a person may come into contact with soil are remediated to meet the residential soil remediation standards, (b) it is clearly demonstrated that for all areas of the real property, other than those described in subparagraph (a) above, engineering and institutional controls can be implemented and maintained on the real property sufficient to meet the health risk standard as established in subsection d. of this section, and (c) a presumptive remedy established and approved by the department pursuant to paragraph (10) of this subsection, or an alternative remedy approved by the department pursuant to paragraph (10) of this subsection, has been approved, as provided in paragraphs (1) and (10) of this subsection;


(4) Remediation shall not be required beyond the regional natural background levels for any particular contaminant.  The department shall develop regulations that set forth a process to identify background levels of contaminants for a particular region.  For the purpose of this paragraph “regional natural background levels” means the concentration of a contaminant consistently present in the environment of the region of the site and which has not been influenced by localized human activities;


(5) Remediation shall not be required of the owner or operator of real property for contamination coming onto the site from another property owned and operated by another person, unless the owner or operator is the person who is liable for cleanup and removal costs pursuant to P.L.1976, c. 141 (
C.58:10-23.11 et seq.
);


(6) Groundwater that is contaminated shall not be required to be remediated to a level or concentration for any particular contaminant lower than the level or concentration that is migrating onto the property from another property owned and operated by another person;


(7) The technical performance, effectiveness and reliability of the proposed remedial action in attaining and maintaining compliance with applicable remediation standards and required health risk standards shall be considered.  In reviewing a proposed remedial action, the department or the licensed site remediation professional shall also consider the ability of the owner or operator to implement the proposed remedial action within a reasonable time frame without jeopardizing public health, safety or the environment;


(8) The use of a remedial action for soil contamination that is determined by the department to be effective in its guidance document created pursuant to section 38 of 
P.L.1993, c. 139
 (
C.58:10B-14
), is presumed to be an appropriate remedial action if it is to be implemented on a site in the manner described by the department in the guidance document and applicable regulations and if all of the conditions for remedy selection provided for in this section are met.  The burden to prove compliance with the criteria in the guidance document is with the person responsible for conducting the remediation;


(9) (Deleted by amendment, 
P.L.1997, c. 278
);


(10) The department shall, by rule or regulation, establish presumptive remedies, use of which shall be required on any site or area of concern to be used for residential purposes, as a child care center licensed pursuant to P.L.1983, c. 492 (
C.30:5B-1 et seq.
), as a public school or private school as defined in 
N.J.S.18A:1-1
, or as a charter school established pursuant to 
P.L.1995, c. 426
 (
C.18A:36A-1 et seq.
).  The department may also issue guidelines that provide for presumptive remedies that may be required as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection, on a site to be used for residential purposes, as a child care center, or as a public school, private school or charter school.  The presumptive remedies shall be based on the historic use of the property, the nature and extent of the contamination at the site, the future use of the site and any other factors deemed relevant by the department.  The department may include the use of engineering and institutional controls in the presumptive remedies authorized pursuant to this subsection.  If the person responsible for conducting the remediation demonstrates to the department that the use of an unrestricted use remedial action or a presumptive remedy is impractical due to conditions at the site, or that an alternative remedy would be equally protective over time as a presumptive remedy, then an alternative remedy for the site that is protective of the public health and safety may be proposed for review and approval by the department;


(11) The department may authorize a person conducting a remediation to divide a contaminated site into one or more areas of concern.  For each area of concern, a different remedial action may be selected provided the requirements of this subsection are met and the remedial action selected is consistent with the future use of the property;  and


(12) The construction of single family residences, public schools, private schools, or charter schools, or child care centers shall be prohibited on a landfill that undergoes a remediation if engineering controls are required for the management of landfill gas or leachate.
The burden to demonstrate that a remedial action is protective of public health, safety and the environment, as applicable, and has been selected in conformance with the provisions of this subsection is with the person responsible for conducting the remediation.
The department may require the person responsible for conducting the remediation to supply the information required pursuant to this subsection as is necessary for the department to make a determination.



h. (1) The department shall adopt regulations which establish a procedure for a person to demonstrate that a particular parcel of land contains large quantities of historical fill material.  Upon a determination by the department that large quantities of historic fill material exist on that parcel of land, there is a rebuttable presumption that the department shall not require any person to remove or treat the fill material in order to comply with applicable health risk or environmental standards.  In these areas the department shall establish by regulation the requirement for engineering or institutional controls that are designed to prevent exposure of these contaminants to humans, that allow for the continued use of the property, that are less costly than removal or treatment, which maintain the health risk standards as established in subsection d. of this section, and, as applicable, are protective of the environment.  The department may rebut the presumption only upon a finding by the preponderance of the evidence that the use of engineering or institutional controls would not be effective in protecting public health, safety, and the environment.  The department may not adopt any rule or regulation that has the effect of shifting the burden of rebutting the presumption.  For the purposes of this paragraph “historic fill material” means generally large volumes of non-indigenous material, no matter what date they were emplaced on the site, used to raise the topographic elevation of a site, which were contaminated prior to emplacement and are in no way connected with the operations at the location of emplacement and which include, but are not limited to, construction debris, dredge spoils, incinerator residue, demolition debris, fly ash, and non-hazardous solid waste.  Historic fill material shall not include any material which is substantially chromate chemical production waste or any other chemical production waste or waste from processing of metal or mineral ores, residues, slags or tailings.


(2) The department shall develop recommendations for remedial actions in large areas of historic industrial contamination.  These recommendations shall be designed to meet the health risk standards established in subsection d. of this section, and to be protective of the environment and shall take into account the industrial history of these sites, the extent of the contamination that may exist, the costs of remedial actions, the economic impacts of these policies, and the anticipated uses of these properties.  The department shall issue a report to the Senate Environment Committee and to the Assembly Environment and Solid Waste Committee, or their successors, explaining these recommendations and making any recommendations for legislative or regulatory action.


(3) The department may not, as a condition of allowing the use of a nonresidential use soil remediation standard, or the use of institutional or engineering controls, require the owner of that real property, except as provided in section 36 of 
P.L.1993, c. 139
 (
C.58:10B-13
), to restrict the use of that property through the filing of a deed easement, covenant, or condition.

(2) The department shall develop recommendations for remedial actions in large areas of historic industrial contamination.  These recommendations shall be designed to meet the health risk standards established in subsection d. of this section, and to be protective of the environment and shall take into account the industrial history of these sites, the extent of the contamination that may exist, the costs of remedial actions, the economic impacts of these policies, and the anticipated uses of these properties.  The department shall issue a report to the Senate Environment Committee and to the Assembly Environment and Solid Waste Committee, or their successors, explaining these recommendations and making any recommendations for legislative or regulatory action.


(3) The department may not, as a condition of allowing the use of a nonresidential use soil remediation standard, or the use of institutional or engineering controls, require the owner of that real property, except as provided in section 36 of 
P.L.1993, c. 139
 (
C.58:10B-13
), to restrict the use of that property through the filing of a deed easement, covenant, or condition.


i. The department may not require a remedial action workplan to be prepared or implemented or engineering or institutional controls to be imposed upon any real property unless sampling performed at that real property demonstrates the existence of contamination above the applicable remediation standards.


j. Upon the approval by the department or by a licensed site remediation professional of a remedial action workplan, or similar plan that describes the extent of contamination at a site and the remedial action to be implemented to address that contamination, the department may not subsequently require a change to that workplan or similar plan in order to compel a different remediation standard due to the fact that the established remediation standards have changed;  however, the department may compel a different remediation standard if the difference between the new remediation standard and the remediation standard approved in the workplan or other plan differs by an order of magnitude.  The limitation to the department's authority to change a workplan or similar plan pursuant to this subsection shall only apply if the workplan or similar plan is being implemented in a reasonable timeframe, as may be indicated in the approved remedial action workplan or similar plan.


k. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, all remediation standards and remedial actions that involve real property located in the Pinelands area shall be consistent with the provisions of the “Pinelands Protection Act,” P.L.1979, c. 111 (
C.13:18A-1 et seq.
), any rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, and with section 502 of the “National Parks and Recreation Act of 1978,” 
16 U.S.C. s.471i
;  and all remediation standards and remedial actions that involve real property located in the Highlands preservation area shall be consistent with the provisions of the “Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act,” 
P.L.2004, c. 120
 (
C.13:20-1
 et al.), and any rules and regulations and the Highlands regional master plan adopted pursuant thereto.


l. Upon the adoption of a remediation standard for a particular contaminant in soil, groundwater, or surface water pursuant to this section, the department may amend that remediation standard only upon a finding that a new standard is necessary to maintain the health risk standards established in subsection d. of section 35 of 
P.L.1993, c. 139
 (
C.58:10B-12
) or to protect the environment, as applicable.  The department may not amend a public health based soil remediation standard to a level that would result in a health risk standard more protective than that provided for in subsection d. of section 35 of 
P.L.1993, c. 139
 (
C.58:10B-12
).


m. Nothing in 
P.L.1993, c. 139
 shall be construed to restrict or in any way diminish the public participation which is otherwise provided under the provisions of the “Spill Compensation and Control Act,” P.L.1976, c. 141 (
C.58:10-23.11 et seq.
).


n. Notwithstanding any provision of subsection a. of section 36 of 
P.L.1993, c. 139
 (
C.58:10B-13
) to the contrary, the department may not require a person intending to implement a remedial action at an underground storage tank facility storing heating oil for on-site consumption at a one to four family residential dwelling to provide advance notice to a municipality prior to implementing that remedial action.


o. A person who has remediated a site pursuant to the provisions of this section, who was liable for the cleanup and removal costs of that discharge pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1) of subsection c. of section 8 of P.L.1976, c. 141 (
C.58:10-23.11g
), and who remains liable for the discharge on that site due to a possibility that a remediation standard may change, undiscovered contamination may be found, or because an engineering control was used to remediate the discharge, shall maintain with the department a current address at which that person may be contacted in the event additional remediation needs to be performed at the site.  The requirement to maintain the current address shall be made part of the conditions of the permit issued pursuant to section 19 of 
P.L.2009, c. 60
 (
C.58:10C-19
) and the final remediation document.

e. In the Attorney General's review of the proposed acquisition, the Attorney General may assess the entity proposing to acquire the nonprofit hospital for reasonable costs related to the review, as determined by the Attorney General to be necessary.  Reasonable costs may include expert review of the acquisition and a process for educating the public about the acquisition and obtaining public input.


f. The Attorney General and the Commissioner of Health shall, during the course of the review pursuant to this section, hold at least one public hearing in which any person may file written comments and exhibits or appear and make a statement.  The public hearing may, if the Attorney General and commissioner so agree, be conducted jointly.  The commissioner may satisfy the requirements of this subsection by conducting a public hearing in conjunction with the certificate of need review process pursuant to P.L.1971, c. 136 (
C.26:2H-1 et seq.
).  The Attorney General or the commissioner may subpoena additional information or witnesses, including, but not limited to, information about any transaction that is collateral to the proposed acquisition and any related documents, require and administer oaths, require sworn statements, take depositions, and use related discovery procedures for purposes of the hearing and at any time prior to completing the review of the proposed acquisition.
The Attorney General shall make the information received pursuant to this section, and the Department of Health shall make any information in its records relating to the proposed acquisition, available for inspection at no cost to the public.
The public hearing shall be held no later than 60 days after the date that an application from a nonprofit hospital is deemed complete by the Attorney General.  Public notice of the hearing shall be provided at least two weeks in advance of the date of the hearing.


g. In a proposed acquisition subject to review under subsection d. of this section, the Attorney General, after consultation with the principal parties to the transaction, shall make a determination as to the amount of assets which the nonprofit hospital shall set aside as a charitable obligation, based on the full and fair market value of the hospital at the time of the proposed acquisition as determined by the Attorney General.


h. Upon execution of a proposed acquisition subject to review under subsection d. of this section, the amount determined by the Attorney General to be set aside as a charitable obligation shall be placed in a nonprofit charitable trust or one or more existing or newly established tax-exempt charitable organizations operating pursuant to 
26 U.S.C. s. 501(c)(3)
