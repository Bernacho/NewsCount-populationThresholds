A. Prior to January 1, 2016, the majority of the members of the governing body of a county may enact an ordinance imposing an excise tax at a rate not to exceed one-fourth percent of the gross receipts of a person engaging in business in the county area for the privilege of engaging in business.  The tax may be imposed in one or more increments of one-sixteenth percent not to exceed an aggregate rate of one-fourth percent.  The tax shall be imposed for a period of not more than ten years from the effective date of the ordinance imposing the tax.  Having enacted an ordinance imposing the tax prior to January 1, 2016 pursuant to the provisions of this section, the governing body may enact subsequent ordinances for succeeding periods of not more than ten years;  provided that each ordinance meets the requirements of this section and of the County Local Option Gross Receipts Taxes Act.  The tax imposed pursuant to the provisions of this section may be referred to as the “quality of life gross receipts tax”.


B. The governing body, at the time of enacting an ordinance imposing the quality of life gross receipts tax, shall dedicate the revenue to cultural programs and activities provided by a local government and to cultural programs, events and activities provided by contract or operating agreement with nonprofit or publicly owned cultural organizations and institutions.


C. The governing body of a class A county with a population of more than two hundred fifty thousand according to the most recent federal decennial census, when dedicating revenue pursuant to Subsection B of this section, shall specify that:

(3) at least three percent but not more than five percent of the revenue shall be dedicated to administration of the revenue;  and

G. The county cultural advisory board shall have the responsibility of overseeing the distribution of the quality of life gross receipts tax revenue for the goals listed in Subsection E of this section.  The board shall:

(2) establish and publicize the necessary qualifications for organizations and institutions to receive quality of life gross receipts tax funding;  and

C. The high-wage jobs tax credit may be claimed and allowed in an amount equal to ten percent of the wages distributed to an eligible employee in a new high-wage economic-based job, but shall not exceed twelve thousand dollars ($12,000) per job per qualifying period.  The high-wage jobs tax credit may be claimed by an eligible employer for each new high-wage economic-based job performed for the year in which the new high-wage economic-based job is created and for the three consecutive qualifying periods as provided in this section.


D. To receive a high-wage jobs tax credit, a taxpayer shall file an application for approval of the credit with the department once per calendar year on forms and in the manner prescribed by the department.  The annual application shall contain the certification required by Subsection K of this section and shall contain all qualifying periods that closed during the calendar year for which the application is made.  Any qualifying period that did not close in the calendar year for which the application is made shall be denied by the department.  The application for a calendar year shall be filed no later than December 31 of the following calendar year.  If a taxpayer fails to file the annual application within the time limits provided in this section, the application shall be denied by the department.  The department shall make a determination on the application within one hundred eighty days of the date on which the application was filed;  provided that the one-hundred-eighty-day period shall not begin until the application is complete, as determined by the department.


E. A new high-wage economic-based job shall not be eligible for a credit pursuant to this section for the initial qualifying period unless the eligible employer's total number of employees with threshold jobs on the last day of the initial qualifying period at the location at which the job is performed or based is at least one more than the number of threshold jobs on the day prior to the date the new high-wage economic-based job was created.  A new high-wage economic-based job shall not be eligible for a credit pursuant to this section for a consecutive qualifying period unless the total number of threshold jobs at a location at which the job is performed or based on the last day of that qualifying period is greater than or equal to the number of threshold jobs at that same location on the last day of the initial qualifying period for the new high-wage economic-based job.


F. Any consecutive qualifying period for a new high-wage economic-based job shall not be eligible for a credit pursuant to this section unless the wage, the forty-eight-week occupancy and the residency requirements for a new high-wage economic-based job are met for each consecutive qualifying period.  If any consecutive qualifying period for a new high-wage economic-based job does not meet the wage, the forty-eight-week occupancy and the residency requirements, all subsequent qualifying periods are ineligible.

I. A new high-wage economic-based job shall not be eligible for a credit pursuant to this section if the job is created due to an eligible employer entering into a contract or becoming a subcontractor to a contract with a governmental entity that replaces one or more entities performing functionally equivalent services for the governmental entity unless the job is a new high-wage economic-based job that was not being performed by an employee of the replaced entity.

A. For the purposes of this section, “distributable amount” means the amount in the county government road fund as of the last day of any month for which a distribution is required to be made pursuant to this section in excess of the balance in that fund as of the last day of the preceding month after reduction for any required distributions for the preceding month.


B. The secretary of transportation shall determine and certify on or before July 1 of each year the total miles of public roads maintained by each county pursuant to 
Section 66-6-23 NMSA 1978

C. Except as provided otherwise in Subsection D of this section, each county shall receive a share of fifty percent of the distributable amount in the county government road fund as determined in this subsection.  The amount for each county shall be the greater of:

(2) the proportionate share that the taxable gallons of gasoline reported for that county for the preceding fiscal year bear to the total taxable gallons of gasoline for all counties in the preceding fiscal year, as determined by the department, multiplied by fifty percent of the distributable amount in the county government road fund.

If the sum of the amounts to be distributed pursuant to Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection exceeds fifty percent of the distributable amount in the county government road fund, the excess shall be eliminated by multiplying the amount determined in Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection for each county by a fraction, the numerator of which is fifty percent of the distributable amount in the county government road fund, and the denominator of which is the sum of amounts determined for all counties in Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection.


(1) twenty-one cents ($.21) multiplied by the county's population as shown by the most recent federal decennial census;  or


(2) the proportionate share that the taxable gallons of gasoline reported for that county for the preceding fiscal year bear to the total taxable gallons of gasoline for all counties in the preceding fiscal year, as determined by the department, multiplied by fifty percent of the distributable amount in the county government road fund.


D. If the distribution for a class A county or for an H class county determined pursuant to Subsections B and C of this section exceeds an amount equal to one-twelfth of the product of the total taxable gallons of gasoline reported for the county for the preceding fiscal year times one cent ($.01), the distribution for that county shall be reduced to an amount equal to one-twelfth of the product of the total taxable gallons of gasoline reported for the county for the preceding fiscal year times one cent ($.01).  Any amount of the reduction shall be shared among the counties whose distribution has not been reduced pursuant to this subsection in the ratio of the amounts computed in Subsections B and C of this section.


E. If a county has not made the required mileage certification pursuant to 
Section 67-3-28.3 NMSA 1978
 by April 1 of every year of the year for which distribution is being made, the secretary of transportation shall estimate the mileage maintained by those counties for the purpose of making distribution to all counties, and the amount calculated to be distributed each month to those counties not certifying mileage shall be reduced by one-third each month for that fiscal year and that amount not distributed to those counties shall be distributed equally to all counties that have certified mileages.


F. Distributions made to counties pursuant to this section shall be deposited in the county road fund to be used for the construction, reconstruction, resurfacing or other improvement or maintenance of the public roads and bridges in the county, including right-of-way and materials acquisition.  Money distributed pursuant to this section may be used by the county to provide matching funds for projects subject to cooperative agreements entered into with the department of transportation pursuant to 
Section 67-3-28 NMSA 1978

A. Prior to January 1, 2016, the majority of the members of the governing body of a municipality may enact an ordinance imposing an excise tax at a rate not to exceed one-fourth percent of the gross receipts of a person engaging in business in the municipality for the privilege of engaging in business.  The tax may be imposed in one or more increments of one-sixteenth percent not to exceed an aggregate rate of one-fourth percent.  The tax shall be imposed for a period of not more than ten years from the effective date of the ordinance imposing the tax.  Having enacted an ordinance imposing the tax prior to January 1, 2016 pursuant to the provisions of this section, the governing body may enact subsequent ordinances for succeeding periods of not more than ten years;  provided that each ordinance meets the requirements of this section and of the Municipal Local Option Gross Receipts Taxes Act.  The tax imposed pursuant to the provisions of this section may be referred to as the “quality of life gross receipts tax”.


B. The governing body, at the time of enacting an ordinance imposing the quality of life gross receipts tax, shall dedicate the revenue to cultural programs and activities provided by a local government and to cultural programs, events and activities provided by contract or operating agreement with nonprofit or publicly owned cultural organizations and institutions.


C. An ordinance imposing any increment of the quality of life gross receipts tax shall not go into effect until after an election is held and a majority of the voters in the municipality voting in the election votes in favor of imposing the tax.  The governing body shall adopt a resolution calling for an election within ninety days of the date the ordinance is adopted on the question of imposing the tax.  The question may be submitted to the voters as a separate question at a general election or at a special election called for that purpose by the governing body.  A special election shall be called, conducted and canvassed in substantially the same manner as provided by law for general elections.  In any election held, the ballot shall clearly state the purpose to which the revenue will be dedicated pursuant to this section.  If a majority of the voters voting on the question approves the ordinance imposing the quality of life gross receipts tax, the ordinance shall become effective in accordance with the provisions of the Municipal Local Option Gross Receipts Taxes Act.  If the question of imposing the quality of life gross receipts tax fails, the governing body shall not again propose the imposition of the tax for a period of one year from the date of the election.

E. The governing body of a municipality that imposes the quality of life gross receipts tax shall, within sixty days of the election approving the imposition of the tax, appoint a municipal cultural advisory board consisting of between nine and fifteen members.  Persons appointed to the board shall be residents of the municipality who are knowledgeable about the activities eligible for quality of life tax funding.  The members of the board shall be appointed for fixed terms and shall not be removed during their terms except for malfeasance.  The terms of the initial board members shall be staggered so that one-third of the members are appointed for one-year terms, one-third are appointed for two-year terms and one-third are appointed for three-year terms.  Subsequent appointments to the board shall be for three-year terms.  If a vacancy on the board occurs, the governing body shall appoint a replacement member for the remainder of the unexpired term.  A board member shall not serve for more than two consecutive terms.


F. The municipal cultural advisory board shall have the responsibility of overseeing the distribution of the quality of life gross receipts tax revenue for the goals listed in Subsection D of this section.  The board shall:

(1) biennially submit recommendations to the governing body for expenditures of revenue from the quality of life gross receipts tax that are allocated pursuant to this section through contracts for services with appropriate organizations and institutions;


(2) establish and publicize the necessary qualifications for organizations and institutions to receive quality of life gross receipts tax funding;  and


(3) develop guidelines and procedures for applying for funding through a request for proposals process and the criteria by which contracts will be awarded.  The evaluation process shall include a public review component.

New Mexico Statutes Chapter 6. Public Finances § 6-28-1. Legislative findings and purpose,https://codes.findlaw.com/nm/chapter-6-public-finances/nm-st-sect-6-28-1.html,"
A. The legislature finds that many residents of this state living within Indian country are impoverished and are involuntarily living without electric service, indoor plumbing, adequate potable water, telecommunications or related infrastructure due to federal government policies over the decades.  This finding is based upon federal decennial census data showing that Native Americans living in Indian country have a long history of income below federal poverty levels and a lack of basic domestic amenities.  Living under such adverse circumstances has a negative impact on the education of children at the elementary and secondary school levels and on the health and welfare of Native Americans in general.


B. Since the nineteenth century, the federal government has assumed a trust responsibility for Native Americans, but since New Mexico attained statehood, it has had a responsibility for its Native American residents.


C. The legislature finds it is the policy of the state of New Mexico to improve the basic quality of life of residents within Indian country through the use of any means available.


D. The purpose of this act is in part to enable the state, in compliance with the provisions of the constitution of New Mexico, to provide financial assistance to residents within Indian country so that they may be served by basic residential services such as electric service, indoor plumbing, sewer, adequate potable water, telecommunications and related infrastructure.


E. The state has developed government-to-government relationships and agreements with the twenty-two Indian nations, tribes and pueblos in New Mexico regarding education and other topics.  To better provide services to Native Americans, many state agencies have designated divisions or liaisons to work with the nations, tribes and pueblos.


F. The state has worked with Indian nations, tribes and pueblos, of which the Navajo Nation is the largest tribal government, and recognizes that the Navajo Nation is divided into political subdivisions designated as chapters.


G. Due to federal, state and tribal policies related to the implementation of capital outlay and other projects, delays in implementation due to bureaucratic red tape have resulted in the reversion of millions of dollars in capital outlay funds designated for projects in Indian country.


H. Tribal governments and their subdivisions have, through the years, organized nonprofit entities to assist in the provision of education and other basic services.

D. If the qualified electors of the county vote in favor of an ordinance imposing a county-wide gasoline tax pursuant to 
Subsection C of Section 7-24A-21 NMSA 1978

A. The legislature finds that no education system can be sufficient for the education of all children unless it is founded on the sound principle that every child can learn and succeed and that the system must meet the needs of all children by recognizing that student success for every child is the fundamental goal.


B. The legislature finds further that the key to student success in New Mexico is to have a multicultural education system that:

(1) attracts and retains quality and diverse teachers to teach New Mexico's multicultural student population;


(2) holds teachers, students, schools, school districts and the state accountable;


(3) integrates the cultural strengths of its diverse student population into the curriculum with high expectations for all students;


(4) recognizes that cultural diversity in the state presents special challenges for policymakers, administrators, teachers and students;


(5) provides students with a rigorous and relevant high school curriculum that prepares them to succeed in college and the workplace;  and


(6) elevates the importance of public education in the state by clarifying the governance structure at different levels.

(5) provides students with a rigorous and relevant high school curriculum that prepares them to succeed in college and the workplace;  and


(6) elevates the importance of public education in the state by clarifying the governance structure at different levels.


C. The legislature finds further that the teacher shortage in this country has affected the ability of New Mexico to compete for the best teachers and that, unless the state and school districts find ways to mentor beginning teachers, intervene with teachers while they still show promise, improve the job satisfaction of quality teachers and elevate the teaching profession by shifting to a professional educator licensing and salary system, public schools will be unable to recruit and retain the highest quality teachers in the teaching profession in New Mexico.


D. The legislature finds further that a well-designed, well-implemented and well-maintained assessment and accountability system is the linchpin of public school reform and must ensure that:

(1) students who do not meet or exceed expectations will be given individual attention and assistance through extended learning programs and individualized tutoring;


(2) students have accurate, useful information about their options and the adequacy of their preparation for post-secondary education, training or employment in order to set and achieve high goals;


(3) teachers who do not meet performance standards must improve their skills or they will not continue to be employed as teachers;


(4) public schools make progress toward educational excellence;  and


(5) school districts and the state are prepared to actively intervene and improve failing public schools.

(4) public schools make progress toward educational excellence;  and


(5) school districts and the state are prepared to actively intervene and improve failing public schools.


E. The legislature finds further that improving children's reading and writing abilities and literacy throughout their years in school must remain a priority of the state.


F. The legislature finds further that the public school governance structure needs to change to provide accountability from the bottom up instead of from the top down.  Each school principal, with the help of school councils made up of parents and teachers, must be the instructional leader in the public school, motivating and holding accountable both teachers and students.  Each local superintendent must function as the school district's chief executive officer and have responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the school district, including personnel and student disciplinary decisions.


G. It is the purpose of the 2003 public school reform legislation as augmented by this 2007 legislation to provide the framework to implement the legislative findings to ensure student success in New Mexico.

A. The legislature shall, by general law, provide for the formation of combined city and county municipal corporations, and for the manner of determining the territorial limits thereof, each of which shall be known as a “city and county,” and, when organized, shall contain a population of at least fifty thousand (50,000) inhabitants.  No such city and county shall be formed except by a majority vote of the qualified electors of the area proposed to be included therein, and if the proposed area includes any area not within the existing limits of a city, a majority of those electors living outside the city, voting separately shall be required.  Any such city and county shall be permitted to frame a charter for its own government, and amend the same, in the manner provided by the legislature by general law for the formation and organization of such corporations.

B. On or before January 31, 2004 and on or before January 31 of each subsequent year, the bureau of business and economic research located at the university of New Mexico shall certify to the taxation and revenue department the population of each municipality in the state.


C. On or before the last day of February of 2004 and of each subsequent year, the taxation and revenue department shall compute the amount to be distributed to each qualifying municipality as follows:

(1) the department first shall compute a distribution share for each qualifying municipality.  The distribution share shall be an amount equal to the product of the qualifying municipality's population multiplied by the difference between the statewide per capita average and the municipal per capita average less the local tax effort of the qualifying municipality;


(2) in 2004 and subsequent years, the balance in the small cities assistance fund in February immediately after the distribution to the fund pursuant to 
Section 7-1-6.2 NMSA 1978
 for the preceding January will be divided by the number of qualifying municipalities.  The quotient will be rounded down to the nearest dollar and may be cited as the “target amount”;


(3) if the target amount determined in Paragraph (2) of this subsection is less than or equal to the minimum amount, the target amount is the amount to be distributed to each qualifying municipality;  and


(4) if the target amount exceeds the minimum amount, the amount to be distributed to all qualifying municipalities whose distribution share equals or is less than the minimum amount shall equal the minimum amount.  The sum to be distributed to such municipalities shall be subtracted from the amount in the fund.  The target amount then shall be increased by dividing the balance remaining in the fund by the number of remaining qualifying municipalities.  The amount to be distributed to each remaining qualifying municipality shall equal the lesser of the municipality's distribution share or the increased target amount.  If the distribution share of one or more of these remaining qualifying municipalities is less than the increased target amount, the balance of the fund is to be further reduced by the amount necessary to provide for a distribution to those municipalities of their distribution shares.  The target amount is to be increased again by dividing the recomputed fund balance by the number of qualifying municipalities not yet provided for.  Successive iterations of the process to increase the target amount shall occur until no remaining municipality's distribution share is less than the increased target amount.

A. The legislature finds that it is in the public interest to provide additional money to enhance or expand vital services to New Mexico's elderly population.  This section provides a means by which individuals may donate all or a portion of their income tax refund, through a voluntary check-off designation, to provide supplemental funding through the non-metro area agency on aging to senior service providers throughout the state.  It is the intent of the legislature that this program of income tax refund check-off is supplemental to any other funding and is in no way intended to take the place of the funding that would otherwise be appropriated for this purpose.


B. Except as otherwise provided in Subsection D of this section, an individual whose state income tax liability after application of allowable credits and tax rebates in a year is lower than the amount of money held by the department to the credit of such individual for that tax year may designate a portion of the income tax refund due to the individual to be paid to the aging and long-term services department for distribution statewide through the area agencies on aging for the provision of supplemental senior services throughout the state, including senior services provided through the north central New Mexico economic development district as the non-metro area agency on aging, the city of Albuquerque/Bernalillo county area agency on aging, the Indian area agency on aging and the Navajo area agency on aging.  In the case of a joint return, both individuals must make the designation.


C. The department shall revise the state income tax form to allow the designation of such contributions in the following form:
“Supplemental Senior Services-Check [ ] if you wish to contribute a part or all of your tax refund to provide supplemental funding to enhance or expand senior services throughout the state.
Enter here $__________ the amount of your contribution.”.


D. The provisions of this section do not apply to income tax refunds subject to interception under the provisions of the Tax Refund Intercept Program Act,  1 and any designation made under the provisions of this section to such refunds is void.


E. The department shall distribute one hundred percent of the tax refund contributions pursuant to this section to the aging and long-term services department for distribution statewide through the area agencies on aging.  The agencies on aging shall cooperatively establish a grant program based on need that is available to all senior service providers in the state that meet the requirements of the program.  The agencies shall seek input from senior service providers in developing the grant program.

C. The petition calling for the creation of the special hospital district shall be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the district or subdistrict is proposed.  The county clerk shall verify that the petition complies with all the requirements of the Special Hospital District Act.  Upon such verification, the county clerk shall certify that fact, along with the petition, to the board of county commissioners.  In the case of a special hospital district composed of all or portions of two or more counties, the board of county commissioners shall notify the boards of county commissioners of the other county or counties which are party to the agreement that a petition for the subdistrict within that county complying with all the requirements of the Special Hospital District Act has been certified and filed.

E. With the assistance of the advisory committee, the director shall develop a draft recovery plan to achieve the following objectives:

(1) restoration and maintenance of a viable population of the threatened or endangered species and its habitat reasonably expected to lead to the delisting of the species;


(2) avoidance or mitigation of adverse social or economic impacts;


(3) identification of social or economic benefits and opportunities;  and


(4) use of volunteer resources and existing economic recovery and assistance programs and funding available from public and private sources to implement the plan.

New Mexico Statutes Chapter 10. Public Officers and Employees § 10-7C-3. Legislative findings and declaration of policy,https://codes.findlaw.com/nm/chapter-10-public-officers-and-employees/nm-st-sect-10-7c-3.html,"
A. The legislature finds and declares that public employees face a severe problem in securing continuing medical insurance when they retire.  Medical care inflation has far exceeded the general inflation rate for the past decade.  It is expected that at least some of the factors that have contributed to this phenomenon will continue into the foreseeable future.  As the public employee population grows older, the ratio of retirees to active employees is expected to continue to rise.  This factor will be exacerbated as the life expectancy of the aged improves and the post-world war two generation approaches retirement age.  Financial problems faced by the federal medicare system are becoming more serious, and it is apparent that there will be attempts to shift those costs to the public employer and employee.  More such cost shifting is likely, and one of the purposes of the Retiree Health Care Act is, within the constraints of what can be afforded by the taxpayers, to alleviate this burden on the retiree as much as possible.


B. The legislature further finds and declares that the public employees covered by the Retiree Health Care Act have entered into public employment in circumstances where they have received in exchange for their services a present salary and an expectation of receiving a future stream of benefits, including payment of certain retirement benefits.  The legislature declares that the expectation of receiving future benefits may be modified from year to year in order to respond to changing financial exigencies, but that such modification must be reasonably calculated to result in the least possible detriment to the expectation and to be consistent with any employer-employee relationship established to meet that expectation.  The legislature does not intend for the Retiree Health Care Act to create trust relationships among the participating employees, retirees, employers and the authority administering the Retiree Health Care Act nor does the legislature intend to create contract rights which may not be modified or extinguished in the future;  rather the legislature intends to create, through the Retiree Health Care Act, a means for maximizing health care services returned to the participants for their participation under the Retiree Health Care Act.


C. The legislature further finds and declares that nothing in the Retiree Health Care Act shall prohibit the legislature from increasing or decreasing participating employer and employee contributions, eligible retiree premiums or group health insurance coverages or plans, and that participation in the Retiree Health Care Act by retired and active public employees shall not be construed to establish rights between the retired and active public employees and the state for health care benefits which cannot be modified or extinguished in the future to meet changes in economic or social conditions.


D. The legislature further finds and declares that the health care coverage provided under the Retiree Health Care Act shall constitute a state group health insurance plan, separate subsequent state group health insurance plan, state group insurance plan, separate subsequent state group insurance plan, state medical group insurance plan and separate subsequent state medical group insurance plan for the purposes of 
Sections 10-11-121
, 
10-12-15
, 10-12A-11 and 
22-11-41 NMSA 1978
.


E. The legislature further finds and declares that participation of current retirees in the Retiree Health Care Act is predicated on 
State ex rel. Hudgins v. Public Employees Retirement Board 58 N.M. 543, 273 P.2d 743 (1954)
;  the additional monthly participation fee to be paid by current retirees as a condition of participation in the Retiree Health Care Act is in lieu of the lump-sum consideration paid by the retirees who were the relators in that case.

A. The legislature finds that:

(1) the poverty rate in New Mexico is the highest in the nation and has exceeded more than twenty percent of the population for most of the past twenty-five years;


(2) having a job does not provide a guarantee of avoiding poverty as demonstrated by the high percentage of persons in the civilian labor force over sixteen years of age with reported incomes in 1989 that were below the poverty level;  and


(3) the diversity of the state, with its residents living in rural and metropolitan areas, reservations and border areas, requires the state to adjust state policies governing economic and social programs for the poor and the working poor to reflect the particular needs of particular locales, not just to create a generic one-size-fits-all program.

B. The legislature finds that education and training are essential to long-term career development.


C. The legislature finds that employment improves the quality of life for parents and children by increasing family income, developing the discipline necessary for self-sufficiency and improving self-esteem, and thus, it is in the public interest to fundamentally alter the state's financial assistance program for needy families with children so both cash and services, including education, job training, child care and transportation provided in accordance with the New Mexico Works Act assist recipients to obtain and keep employment that is sufficient to sustain their families, ensure the dignity of those who receive assistance and strengthen families and families' support for their children.


D. The legislature finds that although most New Mexicans want to work, and in fact New Mexico has been cited as a “like to work” state, not all families can move quickly into the labor force and that regular assessments and key intervention and follow-up can help persons connect to the work force to obtain meaningful work and achieve self-sufficiency.


E. The legislature further finds that the federal act envisions that state and tribal governments will work together to serve participants residing in Indian country, and it is important that the state and the tribal governments work, government to government, to address the issues of availability and delivery of service to the twenty-two tribes and pueblos.


F. The purpose of the New Mexico Works Act is to increase family income through family employment and child support and, by viewing financial assistance as a support service to enable and assist parents to participate in employment rather than as an entitlement, to enable New Mexico to change the culture of the welfare office, both on the part of the department and on the part of the recipients, so that all parties can focus on addressing the barriers to participation in work activities and putting New Mexicans to work.

A. For the purposes of the Social Work Practice Act, a person is practicing social work if he advertises, offers himself to practice, is employed in a position described as social work or holds out to the public or represents in any manner that he is licensed to practice social work in this state.


B. Social work practice means a professional service and emphasizes the use of specialized knowledge of social resources, social systems and human capabilities to effect change in human behavior, emotional responses and social conditions.  Services may be rendered through direct assistance to individuals, couples, families, groups and community organizations.  Social work practice focuses on both direct and indirect services to facilitate change on the intrapersonal, interpersonal and systemic levels.  Areas of specialization that address these include but are not limited to the following:

(1) clinical social work practice, which is the professional application of social work theory and methods in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of psychosocial dysfunction, disability or impairment, including but not limited to emotional and mental disorders.  It is based on knowledge of one or more theories of human development within a psychosocial context.  Clinical social work includes interventions directed to interpersonal interactions, intrapsychic dynamics or life support and management issues.  Clinical social work services consist of assessment, diagnosis and treatment, including psychotherapy and counseling, client-centered advocacy, consultation and evaluation;


(2) social work research practice, which is the professional study of human capabilities and practice of social work specialties, including direct and indirect practice, through the formal organization and the methodology of data collection and the analysis and evaluation of social work data;


(3) social work community organization, planning and development practice, which is a conscious process of social interaction and method of social work concerned with the meeting of broad needs and bringing about and maintaining adjustment between needs and resources in a community or other areas;  helping people to deal more effectively with their problems and objectives by helping them develop, strengthen and maintain qualities of participation, self-direction and cooperation;  and bringing about changes in community and group relationships and in the distribution of decision-making power.  The community is the primary client in community organizations.  The community may be an organization, neighborhood, city, county, state or national entity;


(4) social work administration, which is the practice that is concerned primarily with translating laws, technical knowledge and administrative rulings into organizational goals and operational policies to guide organizational behavior;  designing organizational structure and procedures or processes through which social work goals can be achieved;  and securing resources in the form of material, staff, clients and societal legitimation necessary for goal attainment and organizational survival;  and


(5) university social work faculty, which provides an equal quality of social work education in identified areas of content;  prepares graduates to practice in a range of geographic areas with diverse populations;  and establishes the foundation for practitioners' professional futures, exposing them to the best of current knowledge and developing in them the ability to continue questioning and learning, as well as an awareness of their responsibility to continue this professional development.

B. A school district or charter school that includes a public school in which fewer than eighty-five percent of the enrolled students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch during the prior school year under the National School Lunch Act may establish a breakfast after the bell program to provide free breakfast, after the instructional day has begun, to all students attending that public school;  provided that the program complies with all applicable department rules relating to the breakfast after the bell program authorized by this section.

A. The “lottery student community outreach pilot project” is created as a six-year study that encourages students who receive a tuition scholarship pursuant to the Legislative Lottery Tuition Scholarship Act at participating public post-secondary educational institutions to volunteer to provide community outreach, chiefly through mentoring public school students.  Tuition scholarship students are not required to participate to maintain their tuition scholarship.  The purpose of the pilot project is to demonstrate that:

(1) both mentors and mentees receive similar benefits, including improved grades and on-time graduation and a renewed sense of confidence, purpose and community and civic engagement;


(2) this service improves the community in which the student volunteer works and the public school student lives;


(3) mentoring by young adults can help disadvantaged public school students narrow the achievement gap;  improve cognitive, social and behavioral skills;  and lead to higher test scores and success in school;  and


(4) mentoring can also help the student volunteer improve the student volunteer's skills, test scores and success in college and inculcate civic and social engagement in community life.

B. As used in the Emergency Management Assistance Compact:

(1) “party states” means the participating member states to the compact;  and


(2) “state” means the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and all United States territorial possessions.

D. The Emergency Management Assistance Compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods.  Mutual assistance pursuant to that compact may include the use of the states' national guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.

ARTICLE 2-GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION
A. Each party state entering into the Emergency Management Assistance Compact recognizes that many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under that compact.  Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies that require immediate access and will present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency.  This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.

B. The prompt, full and effective use of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact shall be understood.

C. On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement the Emergency Management Assistance Compact.

The grounds for default include failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, interstate commission bylaws or duly promulgated rules.  The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default.  The interstate commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default.  If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the interstate commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension.  Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the interstate commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer and the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and the state council of such termination.  The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.  The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.  Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a re-enactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.

C. The interstate commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its duly promulgated rules and bylaws against any compacting state in default.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.


D. The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state, which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.  Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be wound-up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.

ARTICLE XIII - Severability and ConstructionA. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.

ARTICLE XIV - Binding Effect of Compact and Other LawsA. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.  All compacting states' laws conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.

B. All lawful actions of the interstate commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the interstate commission, are binding upon the compacting states.  All agreements between the interstate commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.  Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of interstate commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the interstate commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.  In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the interstate commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.
