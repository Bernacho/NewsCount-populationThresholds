    (2) In lieu of requesting a magistrate, the presiding judge may, with the agreement of all judges having child support jurisdiction in a particular county or counties, enter into agreements with juvenile courts to set, enforce, and modify support orders as provided in this part.  In the event such an agreement is entered into, the juvenile court shall have jurisdiction over all support cases in such county, except as may otherwise be provided in the agreement, any contrary provision of law notwithstanding.
  
  
    (3) If a judicial district does not recommend the need for magistrates or if the supreme court and the administrative director of the courts do not approve such recommendation, the supreme court, the administrative director of the courts and the presiding judges of such districts shall provide such information to the commissioner of human services as may be required by the secretary of health and human services for the granting of a waiver in accordance with the federal child support enforcement amendments of 1984 (
P.L. 98-378
      ), or subsequent federal legislation, and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.  In the event the secretary does not grant a waiver for one (1) or more judicial districts, or in the event a waiver is revoked, the supreme court and the administrative director of the courts shall proceed to appoint a magistrate in accordance with subdivision (b)(1)(A) or take such other action as may be required to comply with federal law.
  
  
    (4) The presiding judge shall prescribe which county or counties within the district that a magistrate will serve.  All other terms and conditions of the appointment, including, but not limited to, compensation to be paid and reimbursement of expenses and whether the position shall be full time or part time, shall be prescribed by rule of the supreme court, which is hereby granted such rulemaking authority with regard to the accomplishment of the purposes of this part as it deems appropriate in the public interest.  The compensation to be paid to the magistrates shall be not less than nor more than ninety thousand dollars ($90,000).  On and after July 1, 2008, the base salaries of magistrates appointed pursuant to this section shall be annually adjusted to reflect any actual percentage pay increases provided to all state employees generally, as provided for in the general appropriations act.  Adjustments to annual salary increases as provided for in this subdivision (b)(4) are not to be made on the basis of any class compensation efforts, class compression efforts, or any other method of salary adjustments.
  

  (c) If by July 1, 1986, the presiding judge fails to comply with the provisions of subsection (b), the judge will be deemed to have delegated this responsibility to the supreme court and the administrative director of the courts, and the supreme court shall immediately appoint a magistrate to serve in accordance with this section, if necessary.

  (d) The administrative director of the courts shall have authority to enter into contracts with the Tennessee state IV-D office of child support enforcement to obtain funding for compensation for the magistrate, support staff and other expenses necessary to provide for the performance of duties required in this part and required in part 5 of this chapter.  Such contracts shall be subject to availability of funds.

  (e) The appointment of magistrates in juvenile court that may be necessary to meet the provisions of this section shall be governed by title 37, chapter 1."

      (2)(A) A city, Class A county, or Class B county, or any committee, board, or commission created by these governmental bodies, shall not, pursuant to 
  § 57-5-608
, revoke or suspend the permit of a responsible vendor for a clerk's illegal sale of beer to a minor, if the permit or license holder and the clerk making the sale have complied with the requirements of 
  § 57-5-606
 as a responsible vendor under this part, but may impose on the responsible vendor a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each offense of making or permitting to be made any sales to minors or for any other offense.

.  With respect to such permit or license holder, the committee, board, or commission may, at the time it imposes a revocation or suspension, offer the permit or license holder the alternative of paying a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) for each offense of making or permitting to be made any sales to minors, or a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) for any other offense.
    
    
      (C) Permanent revocation of beer permits may only be applied when the permit holder has at least two (2) violations within a twelve-month period.
    
    
      (D) Revocation of beer permits applies only to that permit holder, or agents of the permit holder, at that location.  Revocation of beer permits shall not stay with the property if the property changes hands, nor may a city, Class A county or Class B county, or any committee, board or commission created by these governmental bodies, apply penalties, suspensions or revocations to other beer permits held by the permittee at other locations.
    
    
      (E) Revocation of a beer permit at one (1) location should not be the sole disqualifying factor when considering the issuance of beer permits at other locations.

    (3) A city or county may at any time accept the payment of a civil penalty, not to exceed the amounts set forth in subdivision (a)(2)(B), by a permit or license holder charged with a violation of this chapter, which payment shall be an admission by the holder of the violation so charged and shall be paid to the exclusion of any other penalty that the city or county may impose.
  

  (b) No permit or license shall be revoked on the grounds the operator or any person working for the operator sells beer to a minor over the age of eighteen (18) years if such minor exhibits an identification, false or otherwise, indicating the minor's age to be twenty-one (21) or over, if the minor's appearance as to maturity is such that the minor might reasonably be presumed to be of such age and is unknown to such person making the sale.  The license or permit may be suspended for a period not to exceed ten (10) days or a civil penalty up to one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500) may be imposed pursuant to subdivision (a)(3).  However, this shall not be construed in any way to relieve the minor from liability for making such illegal purchase as provided in 
      § 57-5-301
    .

  (c) Such revocation, suspension, or imposition of civil penalty may be made for any violation of any provision of this chapter or whenever it shall satisfactorily appear that the premises of any person, firm or corporation holding a permit or license under this chapter are being maintained and operated in such manner as to be detrimental to public health, safety or morals.  The board in considering the suspension or revocation of a license shall consider repeated violations of any local ordinance or state law involving prohibited sexual contact on the premises of an adult oriented establishment.

  (e) Immediately upon the grant of the writ of certiorari, the agency revoking or suspending a license or permit or imposing a civil penalty shall cause to be made, certified and forwarded to the court a complete transcript of the proceedings in the cause.

  (f) This section shall be the sole remedy and exclusive method of review of any action or order that may have been issued by any county legislative body, or any committee appointed by any county legislative body, or from any board or commission authorized under 
      §§ 57-5-105
     and 
      57-5-106
    , including the refusal or failure to grant any license or permit or the imposition of a civil penalty.  The Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure shall be applicable in connection with such review.  Any party dissatisfied with the decree of the court may, upon giving bond as required in other cases, appeal, where the cause shall be heard upon the transcript of the records from the circuit court.

  (g) A judge of any court of record shall have the authority to supersede, stay or enjoin any order of an agency revoking, suspending or imposing a civil penalty made under the authority of this chapter for good cause shown on part of the petitioning party thereof.  No circuit or chancery judge shall have the authority to grant any such extraordinary writ except the judge of a court of record to which the petition for certiorari is addressed.

  (h) If a final judgment is entered by the trial court superseding the revocation or suspension order or order imposing a civil penalty, and the cause is appealed by the agency, the final judgment of the trial court shall remain in force until final appellate disposition of the cause.

  (i) In instances involving only wholesale beer permits or licenses, or certificates of registration, the order of the agency suspending, revoking or failing to renew such wholesale beer permits or licenses or certificates of registration or imposing civil penalties shall as a matter of law be stayed or superseded, and the order will not be effective until final judicial review, including all available appeals, of the matter.  In instances where no appeal is taken or perfected by the wholesaler within the required time as prescribed by law, the order of the agency shall become effective.

  (j) The remedy provided by this section shall be the only method of reviewing orders of county legislative bodies, governing bodies or municipal corporations, boards or committees revoking or suspending licenses issued under this chapter or imposing civil penalties.

  (k) Where a permit or license is revoked, no new license or permit shall be issued to permit the sale of beer on the same premises until after the expiration of one (1) year from the date the revocation becomes final and effective.  The board, in its discretion, may determine that issuance of a license or permit before the expiration of one (1) year from the date of revocation becomes final is appropriate, if the individual applying for such issuance is not the original holder of the license or any family member who could inherit from such individual under the statute of intestate succession.

  (l) Powers to suspend, revoke, or impose civil penalties conferred in this section upon county legislative bodies and governmental bodies of incorporated cities and any committees, commissions, or boards created by such bodies and/or governmental bodies are likewise conferred upon the commissioner of revenue as they may relate to certificates of registration and transportation permits issued by the commissioner under this chapter to any licensed brewer, wholesaler or distributor for the failure of any such person to file with the commissioner any report required by this chapter, or for the filing of a false report, or the failure to pay tax due by any such licensee under this chapter and rules and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto, or for the receipt, possession, storage or transportation of beer in violation of this chapter, or any rule and regulation promulgated by the commissioner thereunder, and for no other reason.  The remedy provided by this section shall likewise be the only method of reviewing orders of the commissioner revoking or suspending certificates of registration and transportation permits issued under this chapter or imposing civil penalties.

  (m) Any county, municipal or metropolitan beer board or committee may, at its discretion, revoke or suspend the permit of or impose a civil penalty pursuant to subdivision (a)(3) on any beer retailer within its jurisdiction who is found to possess beer on which the state beer barrelage tax, imposed by 
      § 57-5-201
    , and the city and county wholesale beer tax, imposed by 
      § 57-6-103
    , has not been paid.  The burden of proof shall be upon the retail beer permit holder to show that the two (2) taxes on the beer in the permit holder's possession have been paid by showing that the beer was purchased from a Tennessee beer wholesaler, which fact shall be shown by the retailer providing a bill of sale or invoice for the beer which shall include the name and address of the wholesaler, the name and address of the retailer, the number of containers of each brand of beer purchased by the retailer, and which shall be signed by the retailer.

  
    
      (n)(1)(A) As a pilot project to terminate July 1, 2014, unless extended by the general assembly, when a local or municipal beer board responsible for controlling the sale of beer or malt beverages within any county included within subsection (p), finds violations, as defined in this chapter, in the sale of beer or malt beverages consumed on-premises of an establishment located within the local or municipal beer board's jurisdiction that result in the beer board suspending the operation of or revoking the permit of the establishment where the violation occurred, the beer board is authorized to notify the executive director of the alcoholic beverage commission by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the action taken by the beer board.  Such notice shall include the record of evidence and the determination made by the beer board in suspending or revoking the permit.
    
    
      (B) Upon receipt of such notice, the executive director of the alcoholic beverage commission shall take the actions required pursuant to

Public Officers and Employees § 8-14-205,"(a) When any person appears without counsel before any court of this state exercising original jurisdiction (whether magistrate, general sessions, municipal, juvenile, circuit, criminal or any court empowered to deprive the person of liberty) upon a criminal prosecution or juvenile delinquency proceeding involving a possible deprivation of liberty, the court shall inquire whether such person is financially able to employ counsel.  If the person claims to be without such means, the court shall examine such person and any witnesses the indigent person or the court may call and proceed to determine whether the person is indigent.  The determination shall not be based alone on the person's ability to make a bail bond, but the court shall consider income, property, obligations, the number and ages of dependents and any other matters deemed pertinent.

  (b) In all habeas corpus and post-conviction proceedings, the court having original jurisdiction of the matter shall determine the question of the petitioner's indigency if such is claimed.

  (c) In every case arising under this section, the court's determination of indigency or nonindigency shall be reduced to writing and signed by the court and filed with the papers of the cause.  If the court is one of record, the court's determination shall also be entered upon its official minutes.

  (d) If the court determines that the person is indigent, as defined in 
      § 8-14-201
    , and the person has not waived the right to counsel, the court shall make and sign an order appointing the district public defender, or such other appointed counsel as provided by law, to represent the person.  The original of the order shall be filed with the papers of the cause, and if the court is one of record, the order shall also be entered upon its official minutes.
  
    (1) If the court appoints the district public defender to represent an accused in any proceeding under this section, but finds the accused is financially able to defray a portion or all the cost to the state of representation by the public defender, then the court shall enter an order directing the party to pay into the registry of the clerk of such court such sum of money as the court determines the accused is able to pay.  Such sum shall be subject to execution as any other judgment and may also be made a condition of discharge from probation.  Such sum as ordered by the court shall be paid by the accused independently and separately from any fines and costs associated with the cause, and such moneys paid by the accused and collected by the clerk of the court pursuant to this section shall be collected independently and separately from any fines and costs associated with the cause and be applied directly to the sum ordered by the court to be paid under this section.  The court may provide for payments to be made at intervals, which the court shall establish, and upon such terms and conditions as are fair and just.  The court may also modify its order when there has been a change in the circumstances of the accused.
  
  
    (2) The clerk of the court shall collect all moneys paid by an accused pursuant to this section.  When the accused fails to comply with the orders of the court, the clerk shall notify the court of the accused's failure to comply.  The clerk shall, at the end of each month, pay to, and forward all payments received pursuant to this section to the office of the executive director of the district public defenders conference.  The clerk of the court shall receive a commission of five percent (5%) of all moneys collected pursuant to the order of the court;  provided, that in counties having a population of more than seven hundred thousand (700,000), according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal census, such commission shall be ten percent (10%).
  

  (e) In any case or proceeding wherein there is more than one (1) indigent person accused, one (1) such person shall be represented by the district public defender's office, and the court shall appoint an attorney to represent such other indigent persons.  Such other indigent persons may also be represented by the district public defender's office;  provided, that the court makes an affirmative finding prior to the appointment that no conflict of interest exists and it appears there is good cause to believe no conflict of interest is likely to arise.  The original of the order shall be filed with the papers of the cause, and if the court is one of record, the order shall also be entered upon its official minutes.

  (f) In any case when the trial court is of the opinion that proper representation of an indigent person or persons makes it necessary to do so, the court may for that purpose appoint one (1) or more senior law students actively participating in a legal aid clinic operated by an approved law school located in the judicial district, in accordance with Tennessee Supreme Court Rule 7.  The legal aid clinic shall be notified promptly of the appointment and shall be furnished a copy of the order of appointment.  The original of the order shall be filed with the papers of the cause, and if the court is one of record, the order shall also be entered upon its official minutes.

  (g) All attorneys and law students appointed as provided in subsections (e) and (f) shall be paid by the state pursuant to 
      §§ 40-14-207
     and 
      40-14-208
    .

  (h) Upon the appointment of the district public defender, and/or an attorney pursuant to subsections (e) and (f), no further proceedings shall be had in the case until such counsel has had reasonably sufficient time and opportunity to prepare the case for trial.  District public defenders shall be authorized access to query state and federal criminal records history information as the duties of their office may require.

  (i) If the court determines that the person accused or proceeded against in any criminal prosecution or other proceeding involving a possible deprivation of liberty, or the person filing a habeas corpus or other post-conviction proceeding is not an indigent person, the court shall advise such person with respect to right to counsel and afford such person a reasonable time, to be fixed by the court, and opportunity to secure counsel and shall stay further proceedings until counsel so obtained has had reasonable time and opportunity to prepare the case for trial."

(ii) Subdivision (b)(3)(D)(i) shall apply only to applications received and approved by the commissioner of revenue and the commissioner of economic and community development on or before January 1, 2011;

      (F) A taxpayer that has established its international, national or regional headquarters in this state and has met the requirements to qualify for the credit provided in

    § 67-1-801
   on the date of such election;  provided, however, that the election shall be available only if the commissioner of revenue and the commissioner of economic and community development determine that allowance of the election is in the best interests of the state.

      (f)(1)(A) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, the department is authorized to lower the speed limits prescribed in this section, and on the state system of roads and highways, as it deems appropriate due to concerns regarding the roadway, traffic, or other conditions.  This authorization to reduce the speed limits set by this section shall be in addition to the authority conveyed by 
  § 55-8-153
.
    
    
      (B) When the department determines that it is necessary to reduce the speed limits set in subsection (a), the commissioner shall so indicate the reduced speed limit via a letter of policy statement, and the commissioner shall cause signs indicating the new speed limit to be erected.
    
    
      (C) Subject to 
  § 55-8-153(c)
, the municipalities of the state are authorized to set speed limits on the public roads and streets within their jurisdictions that are not a part of the interstate and national defense highway system nor any access controlled highway on the state road and highway system.  In addition, the counties of this state are authorized to set speed limits on the public roads and highways within their jurisdiction that are not a part of the interstate or state highway system.  The speed limits for both municipalities and counties shall not exceed fifty-five miles per hour (55 mph).
    
  
  
    (2) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, during the period in which this subsection (f) is in effect, any person who is arrested or receives a traffic citation for driving or operating a motor vehicle in excess of fifty-five miles per hour (55 mph) but less than seventy-five miles per hour (75 mph) on a highway of the interstate and defense highway system or a four-lane controlled-access highway which are federal or state highways, or in excess of fifty-five miles per hour (55 mph) or less than sixty-five miles per hour (65 mph) on a highway or road which has an existing speed limit of sixty-five miles per hour (65 mph) as of March 1, 1974, shall be charged with speeding and upon conviction shall not be fined more than the maximum fine nor less than the minimum fine for speeding as provided by law for that violation, nor shall any costs be imposed or assessed against the person.  Costs shall be imposed in such cases should the person fail to appear or answer the traffic citation as required by law.  The conviction shall not be reported to the department of safety under 
§§ 55-10-306
       and 
55-12-115
      .  Such person shall not be required to attend driver education course as provided in 
§ 55-10-301
      .  The conviction for speeding shall not result in suspension or revocation of operator's or chauffeur's license unless the excess speed constitutes reckless driving, as set out herein.  This subsection (f) shall not apply to trucks as defined in subsection (b) when traveling in excess of sixty-five miles per hour (65 mph) on all highways of the interstate and defense highway system and four-laned controlled-access highways, which are federal or state routes of this state or when traveling in excess of fifty-five miles per hour (55 mph) on any other highways of this state.  A violation of this subsection (f) is a Class C misdemeanor.  However, notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a violation of the reduced speed limits set by the department of transportation, pursuant to 
§ 55-8-153
      , is a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by fine only, when employees of the department or construction workers are present.  The amount of the fine imposed pursuant to 
§ 55-8-153
       shall not be less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500).  Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection (f) to the contrary, no provision of this subsection (f), nor of 
§ 55-8-153
      , shall be construed so as to prevent the entry of a suspended sentence upon the conviction of a defendant for the first violation of the enhanced penalties provided for when the violation occurs within a work zone and when employees of the department of transportation or construction workers are present and when the trier of fact determines that extraordinary circumstances lead to the violation.
  

  
    (g)(1) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, any county having a population of not less than sixty-seven thousand five hundred (67,500) nor more than sixty-seven thousand six hundred (67,600), according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census may assess any person who is arrested or receives a traffic citation for driving or operating a motor vehicle in excess of the posted speed limits an additional fine of five dollars ($5.00).  This fine shall be in addition to any fine assessed under this or any other applicable section.
  
  
    (2) Fines collected pursuant to subdivision (g)(1) shall be placed in a fund to be established by such county.  The fund shall be for the sole purpose of erecting and maintaining highway signs.
  
  
    (3) This subsection (g) shall have no effect unless it is approved by a two-thirds ( 2/3 ) vote of the legislative body of any county to which it may apply.  Its approval or nonapproval shall be proclaimed by the presiding officer of the county legislative body and certified by the presiding officer to the secretary of state.
  

  (h) Notwithstanding any law or regulation to the contrary, only the department of transportation has the authority to set speed limits on access-controlled roadways designated as being on the state system of highways and on roadways designated as being on the state system of interstate highways."

    (B) Upon the request of two (2) or more adjoining counties, or if the governor finds that two (2) or more adjoining counties would be better served by an interjurisdictional arrangement than by maintaining separate emergency management agencies and service, the governor may delineate by executive order or rule an interjurisdictional area adequate to plan for, prevent, mitigate, or respond to emergencies in such area and may direct steps to be taken as necessary, including the creation of an interjurisdictional relationship, a joint emergency plan, a provision for mutual aid, or an area organization for emergency planning and services.  A finding of the governor pursuant to this subdivision (3)(B) shall be based on one (1) or more factors related to the difficulty of maintaining an efficient and effective emergency prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery system on a nonjurisdictional basis, such as:
    
      (i) Small or sparse population;
    
    
      (ii) Limitations on public financial resources severe enough to make maintenance of a separate emergency management agency and services unreasonably burdensome;

      (v) Other relevant conditions or circumstances.

        Such fee shall be assessed and collected in the manner authorized by each such LEPC.
  
  
    (B) The revenue derived from such fee shall be used solely by the LEPC for conducting annual event exercises, educating the public, and printing the Hazardous Materials Emergency Response Plan.
  
  
    (C) This subdivision (4) applies to LEPCs in any county having a population of not less than seventy-one thousand, three hundred (71,300) nor more than seventy-one thousand, four hundred (71,400), according to the 2000 federal census or any subsequent federal census, upon the adoption of a resolution by a two-thirds ( 2/3 ) vote of the county legislative body of such county."

Criminal Procedure § 40-14-202,"(a) In all felony cases, if the accused is not represented by counsel and the court determines by the manner provided in subsection (b) that the accused is an indigent person who has not competently waived the right to counsel, the court shall appoint to represent the accused either the public defender, if there is one for the county, or, in the absence of a public defender, a competent attorney licensed in this state.  The court may call upon any legal aid agency operating in conjunction with an accredited college of law to recommend attorneys for appointment under this part.  The court may, upon its own motion or upon application of counsel appointed under this section, name additional attorneys to aid and assist in the defense.  Each appointment of counsel shall be denoted by an appropriate entry upon the minutes of the court, which shall state the name of counsel and the date of counsel's appointment, but failure of the court to make such a minute entry shall not in any way invalidate the proceeding if an attorney was in fact appointed.  Upon the appointment of an attorney under this section, no further proceeding shall be had until the attorney so appointed has had sufficient opportunity to prepare the case.  If the court should determine that the accused is not an indigent person, the court shall then advise the accused with respect to the accused's right to counsel and afford the accused an opportunity to acquire counsel.

  (b) Whenever an accused informs the court that the accused is financially unable to obtain the assistance of counsel, it is the duty of the court to conduct a full and complete hearing as to the financial ability of the accused to obtain the assistance of counsel and, thereafter, make a finding as to the indigency of the accused.  All statements made by the accused seeking the appointment of counsel shall be by sworn testimony in open court or written affidavit sworn to before the judge.

  (c) When making a finding as to the indigency of an accused, the court shall take into consideration:
  
    (1) The nature of the services to be rendered;
  
  
    (2) The usual and customary charges of an attorney in the community for rendering like or similar services;
  
  
    (3) The income of the accused regardless of source;
  
  
    (4) The poverty level income guidelines compiled and published by the United States department of labor;
  
  
    (5) The ownership or equity in any real or personal property;
  
  
    (6) The amount of the appearance or appeal bond, whether the party has been able to obtain release by making bond, and, if the party obtained release by making bond, the amount of money paid and the source of the money;  and
  
  
    (7) Any other circumstances presented to the court which are relevant to the issue of indigency.
  

  (d) If a social service agency services the criminal justice system of the judicial district, and the court has reasonable cause to believe the accused has the financial resources to employ counsel, the court shall order the agency to conduct an investigation into the financial affairs of the accused and report its findings directly to the court.  The court shall consider the contents of the agency's report in making its determination and the report shall be made a part of the record in the cause.

  (e) If the court appoints counsel to represent an accused in a felony case under this section or in a misdemeanor case as required by law, but finds the accused is financially able to defray a portion or all of the cost of the accused's representation, the court shall enter an order directing the party to pay into the registry of the clerk of the court any sum that the court determines the accused is able to pay.  The sum shall be subject to execution as any other judgment and may also be made a condition of a discharge from probation.  The court may provide for payments to be made at intervals, which the court shall establish, and upon terms and conditions as are fair and just.  The court may also modify its order when there has been a change in circumstances of the accused.

  (f) The clerk of the court shall collect all moneys paid by an accused pursuant to this section.  When the accused fails to comply with the orders of the court, the clerk shall notify the court of the accused's failure to comply.  At the conclusion of the proceedings in the trial court, the court shall order the clerk to pay to the administrative office of the courts any funds that the clerk collected from the accused.  The clerk of the court shall receive a commission of five percent (5%) of the moneys collected for the clerk's services in collecting, handling and making payment pursuant to the order of the court;  provided, that in counties having a population of more than seven hundred thousand (700,000), according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal census, the commission shall be ten percent (10%).

  (g) If a defendant has been ordered to pay all or a portion of the accused's representation pursuant to subsection (d), and if the administrative office of the courts receives funds paid pursuant to subsection (f) that are greater than the total amount which appointed counsel has claimed and has been reimbursed pursuant to 
      Supreme Court Rule 13
    , then any such excess funds shall be paid to the appointed attorney.

  (h) No court shall appoint a member of the general assembly as counsel for an indigent defendant unless the judge of the court certifies that no other equally competent attorney is available to represent the defendant.  If the judge so certifies, it shall not be considered a conflict of interest for the member to represent the defendant or to be compensated for the representation in the same manner and amount as other court appointed attorneys.

  
    (i)(1) Every accused who informs the court that the accused is financially unable to obtain the assistance of counsel shall be required to complete the uniform affidavit of indigency.
  
  
    (2) It is a Class A misdemeanor for any person to intentionally or knowingly misrepresent, falsify or withhold any information required by an affidavit of indigency.
  

  (j) Before and during the trial of a criminal matter, the cover sheets that reflect the total fees and expenses paid to defense counsel and that reflect the total amount paid for expert services from public funds for the use in representing an indigent criminal defendant or prosecuting a criminal defendant are a public record.  In addition, a record of the total amount paid to an expert from public funds is a public record if the expert has offered evidence and is known to the public because of testimony on the record.  Before and during the trial of a criminal matter, detailed attorney fees and expense claims, motions and orders dealing with the authorization of expert services and detailed time sheets of undisclosed experts shall be sealed and unavailable for public inspection."

Taxes and Licenses § 67-5-705,"(a) This section shall be known and may be cited as the “Property Tax Freeze Act.”

  (b) The purpose of this section is to provide for uniform and orderly administration of the property tax freeze program for eligible taxpayers in those jurisdictions adopting it.  This section is not intended to displace other forms of property tax relief available at the time of its passage except as expressly provided in this section.

  (c) As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:
  
    (1) “Base tax” means the property tax due on the principal residence of a qualifying taxpayer at the time the jurisdiction levying the tax adopts a resolution or ordinance approving the property tax freeze under this section.  If the taxpayer did not qualify or did not own an eligible residence when the freeze was adopted, “base tax” means the maximum property tax due on the taxpayer's eligible residence for the year in which the taxpayer became eligible on the basis of an approved application.  If a taxpayer reapplies after acquiring a new residence or after a period of ineligibility, the base tax shall be recalculated for the year of reapplication and reestablishment of eligibility;
  
  
    (2) “Collecting official” means the county trustee or, in the case of taxes due a municipality, the county trustee or other official responsible for collection of property taxes;
  
  
    (3) “Improvement” means any change to a dwelling or dwelling lot that would properly warrant a change by the assessor in the assessed value of the property for the year or portion of the year in which the improvement is made;  and
  
  
    (4) “Principal residence” means the dwelling owned by the taxpayer and eligible as the taxpayer's legal residence for voting purposes.  Program rules shall establish the maximum size limits for land that may qualify as a taxpayer's principal residence.  The rules shall take into consideration lot size requirements under applicable zoning, as well as property actually used to support residential structures;  provided, however, that the size limit shall not exceed five (5) acres.  The tax freeze granted by this section shall only apply to the residence and no more than the maximum limit for land established by the rules.
  

  (d) The legislative body of any county or municipality may by resolution or ordinance adopt the property tax freeze program provided in this section.  The county or municipality may thereafter terminate the freeze program by resolution or ordinance;  provided, however, that the resolution or ordinance terminating the program shall not have the effect of terminating the program until the following tax year.

  
    (e)(1) Taxpayers seeking the property tax freeze shall apply annually to the collecting official by the deadline established in program rules, and applicants must qualify on the basis of age, income and ownership of eligible property.  The collecting official shall determine whether requirements for eligibility have been met, and the collecting official's determination shall be final, subject to audit and recovery of taxes, including penalty and interest at the rates otherwise provided for delinquent taxes under 
§ 67-5-2010
      , if the applicant is later determined to have not been eligible.  Any taxpayer who knowingly provides false information concerning the taxpayer's income or other information relative to eligibility for the program, commits a Class A misdemeanor.
  
  
    (2) If the collecting official approves the application, property taxes due on the applicant's principal residence shall be the lesser of:
    
      (A) The actual tax due;  or
    
    
      (B) The base tax;  provided, that the base tax shall be adjusted to reflect any percentage increase in the value of the property determined by the assessor to be attributed to improvements made or discovered after the time the base tax was established.  The base tax shall be recalculated in any year in which the actual tax due is less than the previously established base tax for the property, and the recalculated base tax shall apply until further recalculated pursuant to this part.
    
  

  
    (f)(1) To qualify for the property tax freeze, the applicant shall be sixty-five (65) years of age by the end of the year in which the application is filed.  The applicant shall further own and use the property as the applicant's principal residence for which the freeze is sought in the year of application or reapplication and through the deadline date for application or reapplication.
  
  
    (2) In addition to the qualifications stated in subdivision (f)(1), the applicant's income, combined with the income of any other owners of the property, the income of applicant's spouse and the income of any owner of a remainder or reversion in the property if the property constituted the person's legal residence at any time during the year, may not exceed the limit stated in subdivision (f)(3).  Income for purposes of qualification means income from all sources as defined by program rules.
  
  
    (3) The income limit for the property tax freeze program shall be the greater of the weighted average of the median household income for age groups sixty-five (65) years of age to seventy-four (74) years of age and seventy-five (75) years of age or over who resided within the county as determined in the most recent federal decennial census, or the applicable state tax relief income limit established under 
§ 67-5-702
      .  This limit shall be adjusted by the comptroller of the treasury to reflect the cost of living adjustment for social security recipients as determined by the social security administration and shall be rounded to the nearest ten dollars ($10.00).  The adjusted weighted average median household income level for each county shall be published annually by the comptroller of the treasury.
  

  
    (g)(1) The comptroller of the treasury is authorized to perform income verification or other related services or assistance at the request of a county or municipality, if the county or municipality agrees to pay fees sufficient to reimburse the actual costs to the comptroller of the treasury in providing such services or assistance, unless or to the extent not appropriated by the general assembly.
  
  
    (2) Financial records filed for purposes of income verification shall be confidential and shall not be subject to inspection under the Tennessee public records law, compiled in title 10, chapter 7, but shall be available to local or state officials who administer, enforce, or audit the tax freeze program or requirements imposed under this section.
  

  (h) The property tax freeze program shall conform to any uniform definitions, application forms and requirements, income verification procedures and other necessary or desirable rules, regulations, policies and procedures not in conflict with this section, as may be adopted by the state board of equalization through the division of property assessments."

§ 57-3-204(e)(7)(B)
       by a wholesaler for those products manufactured and sold by the manufacturer at its retail store as authorized pursuant to 
§ 57-3-204(e)(7)
      .
  

  (b) The inspection fees shall not exceed eight percent (8%) of the wholesale price of alcoholic beverages supplied by a wholesaler in municipalities located in counties of this state having a population of less than sixty thousand (60,000), according to the 1960 federal census or any subsequent federal census, or in counties that contain a municipal corporation as defined in 
      § 67-6-103(a)(3)(B)(i)
    , notwithstanding subsection (c) to the contrary.

  (c) The inspection fees shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the wholesale price of alcoholic beverages supplied by a wholesaler in municipalities located in counties of this state having a population of more than sixty thousand (60,000), according to the 1960 federal census or any subsequent federal census.

  (d) Any municipality having a metropolitan form of government and a population of over four hundred fifty thousand (450,000), according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal census, which has levied the inspection fees herein authorized may, by ordinance of its legislative body, designate the county clerk as the collector of the fees for the entire metropolitan taxing jurisdiction."

    (4) This subsection (o) shall not apply to a state probation officer employed by the department of correction and paid by the state of Tennessee.
  

  
    (p)(1) If a defendant is granted probation pursuant to this section and is released to the department charged by law with the supervision of probationers, the department may contract with an approved private probation provider to furnish probation supervision and services to such defendant if:
    
      (A) The defendant's conviction offense was for a Class E felony;  and
    
    
      (B) The caseloads of state probation officers where the defendant is being supervised are high, resulting in the likelihood that the probationer may receive increased supervision and services from a private probation provider;  or
    
    
      (C) The private probation provider offers specialized services, treatment or training that would be beneficial to a probationer but would not be available if the probationer is supervised by the department.
    
  
  
    (2) To contract with the department for the supervision of felons described in subdivision (p)(1)(A), a private probation provider shall:

      (3)(A) A private probation provider who meets the requirements of subdivision (p)(2) and who wants to contract with the department to provide probation services to felons described in subdivision (p)(1)(A), may register with the department and the private probation council.
    
    
      (B) At the time of registration, the private provider shall submit to the department and council:
      
(i) Such documentation as is necessary to demonstrate that it meets the requirements of subdivision (p)(2);  and
      
      
(ii) A specific plan demonstrating how the use of such provider to supervise and provide services to felons described in subdivision (p)(1)(A), who have been granted probation will further the overall goal of reducing the recidivism rate of probationers.  Such plan shall also contain statistics for misdemeanor probation services provided by the private provider for the previous ten (10) years.  At a minimum, the statistics contained in the plan shall contain the same information required to be maintained by subdivision (p)(5).
      
    
    
      (C) If the documentation and recidivism rate reduction plan presented by the private provider demonstrates that it meets the requirements of subdivision (p)(2), the department and council shall approve the private provider and place such provider on a list of companies eligible to contract with the department pursuant to this subsection (p).
    
  
  
    (4) A supervision contract authorized by this section shall be between the private provider and the department.  Once the court grants a person's petition for probation, the department shall be the sole entity that determines who supervises the probationer.  No probationer meeting the criteria set out in subdivision (p)(1)(A) shall be placed under the supervision of or supervised by a private provider that has not contracted with the department and is not on the list of companies approved by the department and the council.
  
  
    (5) Any private provider who contracts with the department pursuant to this subsection (p) shall maintain statistics on the probationers supervised pursuant to this subsection (p) and shall submit a quarterly report of such statistics to the person or agency designated by the department.  The statistics shall include, but not be limited to:
    
      (A) The number of felony probationers described in subdivision (p)(1)(A) the private provider has contracted to supervise;
    
    
      (B) The style of the case which resulted in the defendant being placed on probation;
    
    
      (C) The number of felons described in subdivision (p)(1)(A), whose probation was revoked prior to the end of supervision;  and
    
    
      (D) The recidivism rate of the felony probationers supervision by the private provider under a contract authorized by this subsection (p).
    
  
  
    
      (6)(A) A private provider contracting to supervise felons described in subdivision (p)(1)(A) may charge a supervision fee not to exceed sixty dollars ($60.00) per month.  However, if a probationer cannot afford all or part of the supervision fee, the probationer may go before the court placing the defendant on probation and petition that it be waived or reduced.  For good cause shown, the court may waive or reduce the supervision fee in appropriate cases.
    
    
      (B) Willful nonpayment of the supervision fee to the private probation provider shall be grounds for revocation and the provider shall report instances of nonpayment to the department in the manner specified in the contract.
    
  
  
    (7) No employee of a private provider of probation services shall supervise a felon described in subdivision (p)(1)(A) unless the employee has a bachelor of science degree from an accredited college or university or at least two (2) years of related work experience.

  § 7-55-106
 shall not apply to such certificate for an industrial park.  The committee shall investigate, find and determine, upon application of any municipality therefor, as to whether a certificate of public purpose and necessity shall be issued to such municipality to engage in the establishment of an industrial park project under the declared public policy of this part for the economic development and advancement of the municipality, and in considering and determining whether or not such certificate shall issue, the committee shall find and determine affirmatively that:
      
(i) The project is well conceived and has a reasonable prospect of success;
      
      
(ii) There is a good probability that the project will be self-sustaining from the sale and lease of land in the industrial park, utility revenues derived from the provision and sale of utilities in the industrial park, ad valorem and other taxes resulting directly from the development of the industrial park, and other fees and charges for services provided to the industrial park;
      
      
(iii) The project will tend to provide proper economic development of the municipality, and will encourage industry to locate there;  and
      
      
(iv) There are adequate property values and suitable financial conditions, so that the total bonded indebtedness of the municipality, solely for the purposes authorized by this part and by title 7, chapter 55, shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total assessed valuation of all the property in the municipality ascertained by the last completed assessment at the time of the issuance of such bonds.

    (2) When the committee has determined such facts favorably, it is authorized and empowered, having due regard to the promotion of the public policy and the general welfare herein declared, to issue a certificate of public purpose and necessity to the municipality to engage in the project.  If and when such certificate is issued, it shall authorize the particular municipality to do all of the things authorized under 
§ 13-16-203

    (b)(1) If and when the certificate is issued, the committee therein shall fix and determine:

      (C) The terms upon which such acquisition may be had.

  (e) Notwithstanding this section, a municipality with a population not less than three hundred thousand (300,000), according to the 2000 federal census or any subsequent federal census, shall not be required to obtain a certificate of public purpose and necessity in order to borrow funds to develop an industrial park under this part.  Any such municipality that makes a total pledge of full faith and credit of the municipality related to an industrial park project shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the total assessed valuation of all property in the municipality, ascertained by the last completed assessment at the time of issuance of the obligations.  In any resolution pledging the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing power of any such municipality to secure any obligations related to the project, the governing body of the municipality shall state that the project being considered is well conceived, has a reasonable prospect for success, will provide proper economic development and employment, and will not likely become a burden on the taxpayers of the municipality.

      § 6-58-101
    .  Either a city or town and county, or both, operating a joint industrial park may exercise the power of eminent domain with respect to property located within the jurisdictional boundaries of the county and within an urban growth boundary and a planned growth area.  Before a city or county may undertake to exercise the power of eminent domain for development of an industrial park, it must obtain a certificate of public purpose and necessity as provided in subsection (a), even if no funds will be borrowed for the project, except:
  
    (1) The requirements of subdivision (a)(1)(A)(iv) are not applicable to a certificate of public purpose and necessity obtained solely for the exercise of eminent domain authority;  and
  
  
    (2) A certificate of public purpose and necessity for the exercise of eminent domain, in addition to the applicable findings set forth in subdivision (a)(1)(A), shall be based on a finding that the city or county has been unable, through good faith negotiations, to acquire the property to be acquired by eminent domain or any alternative property that would be of comparable suitability for the project.  Good faith negotiations shall be established, if the city or county has made an offer to purchase the property for an amount equal to or in excess of the fair market value, determined by the average of at least two (2) appraisals by independent, qualified appraisers."

  (b) In appointing members to any statutorily created decision-making or regulatory board, commission, council, or committee of the state, the appointing authority should make a conscientious effort to select, from among the most qualified persons, those persons whose appointment would ensure that the membership of the board, commission, council, or committee accurately reflects the proportion that each group of minority persons represents in the population of the state as a whole, or, in the case of a local board, commission, council, or committee, in the population of the area represented by the board, commission, council, or committee, as determined pursuant to the most recent federal decennial census, unless the law regulating such appointment requires otherwise, or persons of the under-represented minority group cannot be recruited.  If the size of the board, commission, council, or committee precludes an accurate representation of all minority groups, appointments should be made which conform to the requirements of this section insofar as possible.  If there are multiple appointing authorities for the board, commission, council, or committee, they shall consult with each other to assure compliance with this section.

  (c) Each appointing authority described in subsection (c) shall submit a report to the secretary of state annually by December 1, which discloses the number of appointments made during the preceding year from each minority group and the number of non-minority appointments made, expressed both in numerical terms and as a percentage of the total membership of the board, commission, council, or committee.  A copy of the report shall be submitted to the governor, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the speaker of the senate.  In addition, each appointing authority shall designate a person responsible for retaining all applications for appointment who shall ensure that information describing each applicant's race, ethnicity, gender, and qualifications is available for public inspection during reasonable hours.  Nothing in this section requires disclosure of an applicant's identity or of any other information made confidential by law.

  (d) This section applies to appointments and reappointments made after July 1, 1997.  It does not prohibit a member of a decision-making or regulatory board, commission, council, or committee from completing a term being served as such member when this section takes effect.  A person appointed to a decision-making or regulatory board, commission, council, or committee before July 1, 1997, may not be removed from office solely for the purpose of meeting the requirements of this section."

    (4) It is the intent of the general assembly to distinguish between licenses authorized generally under this title and those specifically authorized under this section.  Because licenses granted under this section include the retail sale of liquor, spirits and high alcohol content beer which contain a higher alcohol content than those contained in wine or beer, as defined in§ 57-5-101(b), it is in the interest of this state to maintain a higher degree of oversight, control and accountability for individuals involved in the ownership, management and control of licensed retail premises.  For these reasons, it is in the best interest of the health, safety and welfare of this state to require all licensees to be residents of this state as provided herein and the commission is authorized and instructed to prescribe such inspection, reporting and educational programs as it shall deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that the laws, rules and regulations governing such licensees are observed.
  

  (c) Every retail licensee shall, before employing any person to dispense alcoholic beverages, secure from the commission an employee's permit authorizing such person to serve as an employee in the place of business of the retailer.  It is made the duty of the retailer to see that each person dispensing alcoholic beverages in the retailer's place of business has an employee's permit as above required, which permit must be on the person of such employee or upon the premises of the licensee at all times subject to inspection by the commission or its duly authorized agent.  This subsection (c) shall cease to be effective July 1, 2016, when employees of a retail licensee are required to be certified clerks pursuant to 
      § 57-3-818
    .

  
    (d)(1) If a retail licensee ceases to do business through the voluntary or involuntary loss of the licensee's license, or if a person not licensed under this chapter obtains title to alcoholic beverages of a retail licensee as a result of a defaulted loan or execution, the wholesaler who sold the alcoholic beverages to the retailer shall purchase such alcoholic beverages from the retailer at a base price of the wholesalers' laid-in cost of such alcoholic beverage.  A wholesaler shall be permitted an offset or charge against such payment for any outstanding obligation owed to the wholesaler by such licensee or for reasonable labor, restocking and transportation charges.
  
  
    (2) Any licensee objecting to the reasonableness of the offset or charge may petition the commission to review such, and shall designate the wholesaler as a respondent.  The commission shall conduct a contested case hearing pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5, part 3, to consider the objection.
  
  
    (3) The obligation imposed on a wholesaler under this section does not apply to any product which:
    
      (A) Is damaged or cannot be legally sold in this state;
    
    
      (B) Is not sold to a retailer within one hundred eighty (180) days of demand for repayment;

      (E) Is sold in a commemorative bottle, seasonal decanter or other novelty container.

§ 57-3-202
      , or under chapter 2 of this title, is authorized to obtain a license under this section for the retail sale of alcoholic beverages or products containing alcohol subject to the further restrictions of this subsection (e).

Property § 66-5-108,"(a)(1) The general assembly finds that many owners of agricultural property who have separated titles have difficulty acquiring loans and in other ways have been hindered in fully developing the surface of land.
  
  
    (2) The general assembly further finds that there are mineral estates, separated from the surface, that have not been properly registered in the counties in which they are located, and are, therefore, not on the tax rolls, causing a significant loss of revenue to many Tennessee counties.
  
  
    (3) Further, the general assembly finds that many surface owners cannot discover from records at their courthouses whether they own the underlying mineral estate, or if they do not, who does, and that this situation causes undue hardship and title uncertainty for surface owners.
  
  
    (4) The general assembly further finds that where there are abandoned mineral estates, those on which no development has taken place, no taxes paid and no claim filed pursuant to this section, the rational development of minerals in Tennessee is hindered.
  
  
    (5) Thus, to promote commerce and agriculture and proper development of surface and mineral estates and to remedy uncertainties in title, the general assembly adopts this section.

  (c) Any interest in coal, oil and gas, and other minerals shall, if unused for a period of twenty (20) years, be extinguished, unless a statement of claim is filed in accordance with subsection (d), and the ownership of the mineral interest shall revert to the owner of the surface.

  
    (d)(1) The statement of claim provided in subsection (c) shall be filed by the owner of the mineral interest prior to the end of the twenty-year period set forth in subsection (c) or within three (3) years after July 1, 1987, whichever is later.

Cities and Towns § 6-54-113,https://codes.findlaw.com/tn/title-6-cities-and-towns/tn-code-sect-6-54-113.html,Tennessee Code Title 6. Cities and Towns § 6-54-113,"(a)(1) “Municipality,” as used in this section, includes incorporated cities and towns and metropolitan governments.
  
  
    (2) The authority provided in this section is permissive and not mandatory and may or may not be exercised by a municipality, as each municipality deems appropriate.
  

  (b) If it is determined by the appropriate department or person as designated by the governing body of a municipality that any owner of record of real property has created, maintained or permitted to be maintained on such property the growth of trees, vines, grass, underbrush or the accumulation of debris, trash, litter, or garbage, or any combination of the preceding elements, so as to endanger the health, safety or welfare of other citizens or to encourage the infestation of rats and other harmful animals, the appropriate department or person shall provide notice to the owner of record to remedy the condition immediately.  The notice shall be given by United States mail, addressed to the last known address of the owner of record.  When an attempt at notification by United States mail fails or no valid last known address exists for the owner of record, the municipality may publish the notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the property sits for no less than two (2) consecutive issues or personally deliver the notice to the owner of record.  For purposes of this section, such publication shall constitute receipt of notice effective on the date of the second publication of the notice and personal delivery shall constitute receipt of notice immediately upon delivery. The notice shall state that the owner of the property is entitled to a hearing.  The notice shall be written in plain language and shall also include, but not be limited to, the following elements:
  
    (1) A brief statement of this section, which shall contain the consequences of failing to remedy the noted condition;
  
  
    (2) The person, office, address and telephone number of the department or person giving notice;
  
  
    (3) A cost estimate for remedying the noted condition, which shall be in conformity with the standards of cost in the community;  and
  
  
    (4) A place wherein the notified party may return a copy of the notice, indicating the desire for a hearing.
  

  
    
      (c)(1)(A) If the person fails or refuses to remedy the condition within ten (10) days after receiving the notice, the appropriate department or person shall immediately cause the condition to be remedied or removed at a cost in conformity with reasonable standards and the cost thereof assessed against the owner of the property.  The municipality may collect the costs assessed against the owner through an action for debt filed in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The municipality may bring one (1) action for debt against more than one (1) or all of the owners of properties against whom such costs have been assessed, and the fact that multiple owners have been joined in one (1) action shall not be considered by the court as a misjoinder of parties.  Upon the filing of the notice with the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the property lies, the costs shall be a lien on the property in favor of the municipality, second only to liens of the state, county and municipality for taxes, any lien of the municipality for special assessments, and any valid lien, right or interest in such property duly recorded or duly perfected by filing, prior to the filing of such notice.  These costs shall be collected by the municipal tax collector or county trustee at the same time and in the same manner as property taxes are collected.  If the owner fails to pay the costs, they may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as delinquent property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalty and interest as delinquent property taxes.
    
    
      (B) When the owner of an owner-occupied residential property fails or refuses to remedy the condition within ten (10) days after receiving the notice, the appropriate department or person shall immediately cause the condition to be remedied or removed at a cost in accordance with reasonable standards in the community, with these costs to be assessed against the owner of the property.  Subdivision (c)(1)(A) shall apply to the collection of costs against the owner of an owner-occupied residential property, except that the municipality shall wait until cumulative charges for remediation equal or exceed five hundred dollars ($500) before filing the notice with the register of deeds and the charges becoming a lien on the property.  After this threshold has been met and the lien attaches, charges for costs for which the lien attached are collectible as provided in subdivision (c)(1)(A) for these charges.
    
  
  
    (2) If the person who is the owner of record is a carrier engaged in the transportation of property or is a utility transmitting communications, electricity, gas, liquids, steam, sewerage or other materials, the ten-day period specified in subdivision (a)(1) shall be twenty (20) days, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays.
  

  
    (d)(1) The municipal governing body or the appropriate department, or both, may make any rules and regulations necessary for the administration and enforcement of this section.  The municipality shall provide for a hearing upon request of the person aggrieved by the determination made pursuant to subsection (b).  A request for a hearing shall be made within ten (10) days following the receipt of the notice issued pursuant to subsection (b).  Failure to make the request within this time shall without exception constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing.
  
  
    (2) Any person aggrieved by an order or act of the board, agency or commission under this subsection (d) may seek judicial review of the order or act.  The time period established in subsection (c) shall be stayed during the pendency of a hearing.
  

  (e) The provisions of this section are in addition and supplemental to, and not in substitution for, similar authority in any municipality's charter or other applicable law.

  (f) In the event a privately owned cemetery would otherwise meet the requirements of this section, and if a Boy Scout troop or other organization were to remedy the conditions existing on such property, the municipality shall be prohibited from filing a lien against such property for the value of the work performed by such organization.  Such organization shall be immune from any legal action for damages, and no cause of action for civil or criminal liability may be brought by the owner of record of the cemetery or descendants of those buried in the cemetery against such organization, so long as reasonable care is taken by such organization not to violate 
      § 46-2-105
    , 
      § 46-3-108
    , or any other provision of law, rule or regulation.

  
    (g)(1) As used in this subsection (g):
    
      (A) “Community organization” means a community-oriented organization or group including, but not limited to, a school group, church youth group, neighborhood preservation nonprofit corporation, or community support group;  and
    
    
      (B) “Vacant property” means property on which no building exists or on which a building exists but any such building is no longer utilized for any business, commercial or residential purposes.
    
  
  
    (2) Except as provided in subsection (f), if a person fails to remedy the condition on vacant property within the time period prescribed by subsection (c), subject to any stay as provided in subsection (d), upon the adoption of a resolution by a two-thirds ( 2/3 ) vote of the municipal legislative body of any municipality located in any county having a population in excess of eight hundred thousand (800,000), according to the 2000 federal census or any subsequent federal census, to implement this subsection (g) within any such municipality, a community organization shall be entitled to petition the municipality to enter upon such vacant property to remedy the conditions identified in subsection (b).  Upon the filing of such a petition, the municipality is authorized to contract with such community organization for such purposes.  The contract shall provide for the manner in which the community organization shall be compensated for remedying the conditions pursuant to such contract.  Any municipality that contracts with a community organization for such purposes shall be absolutely immune from any liability to any and all persons and for damage to the vacant property for conditions remedied by the community organization.  No monetary liability and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against the municipality for acts of omission or commission of such community organization for conditions remedied pursuant to such contract."

  (c) The parties by mutual consent may modify the terms of the memorandum of understanding at any time before its termination.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit a behavioral contract or agreement setting out behavior or goals expected of and to be achieved by the defendant made between a counselor and defendant, but that agreement need not be filed with the court.

  (d) The memorandum of understanding shall be terminated and the prosecution may resume as if there had been no memorandum of understanding if either the defendant or prosecuting attorney files a notice that the memorandum of understanding is terminated.  If the memorandum of understanding is terminated by the prosecution, the defendant may petition the court to review the action of the prosecution to determine whether the prosecution acted arbitrarily, capriciously or abused its discretion to terminate.  If the court so finds, it may order the defendant reinstated under the defendant's memorandum of understanding or order the pending charges dismissed with or without jeopardy attaching.

  (e) The trial court shall dismiss with prejudice any warrant or charge against the defendant upon the expiration of ninety (90) days after the expiration of the period of suspension specified in the memorandum of understanding is filed;  provided, that no termination of the memorandum of understanding has been filed under subsection (d).  If the prosecution is dismissed with prejudice, jeopardy shall attach and the court shall make a minute entry to that effect.  Upon dismissing any warrant or charge against the defendant pursuant to this section, the judge shall send or cause to be sent a copy of the order of dismissal to the Tennessee bureau of investigation for entry into its expunged criminal offender and pretrial diversion database;  provided, however, that the court shall not be required to send to the bureau a copy of any dismissal order dated on or after July 1, 1999, if the charge dismissed is classified as a Class B or C misdemeanor.  The order of dismissal shall include the name of the defendant, the defendant's date of birth and social security number, the offense for which diversion was granted, the date diversion was granted and the date the charge or warrant was dismissed."

    (2) The pledge of and lien on revenues and the statutory mortgage lien hereinabove described shall be valid and binding from the time the pledge or lien is created or granted and shall inure to the benefit of the public building authority or contracting party, or their assigns, until the obligations secured are paid and performed in full.  The priority of any pledge or lien with respect to competing pledges or liens shall be determined by the date such pledge or lien is created or granted and neither the lease, loan agreement, sales contract or operating contract nor any other instrument granting, creating or giving notice of the pledge or lien needs to be filed or recorded in order to preserve or protect the validity or priority of such pledge or lien.
  
  
    (3) The governing body of a municipal corporation entering into a lease, loan agreement, sales contract or operating agreement described in this subsection (b) shall prescribe and collect, or cause to be prescribed and collected, reasonable rates, fees or charges for the services, facilities and commodities of the project or projects, and shall revise such rates, fees, or charges from time to time, whenever necessary, so that the project or projects shall be and always remain self-supporting.  The rates, fees or charges prescribed shall be at least sufficient to produce revenue to provide for all expenses of operation and maintenance of the project or projects, including reasonable reserves therefor, and pay when due all bonds and notes and interest thereon and all obligations under any lease, loan agreement, sales contract or operating contract for the payment of which such revenue is or shall have been pledged, charged or otherwise encumbered, including reasonable reserves therefor.  A municipal corporation described in

    (4) The proceeds of any lease, loan agreement, sales contract or operating contract executed and delivered pursuant to this chapter to refund outstanding obligations issued by a county or metropolitan government for school capital outlay purposes shall not be required to be shared as provided herein, unless the outstanding obligations to be refunded were payable as provided in subdivision (c)(3) and the lease, loan agreement, sales contract or operating contract executed and delivered to accomplish such refunding is payable from taxes to be levied on all taxable property in the county or metropolitan government.
  
  
    (5) This subsection (c) are not applicable in counties and metropolitan governments having a population in excess of eight hundred thousand (800,000), according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal census, or any municipality within such county served by a municipal or special school district.

    (2) A supplemental petition shall be filed with the utility management review board simultaneously with the filing of the petition with the county mayor or county mayors but is not subject to approval or disapproval by the utility management review board as set forth in

§ 7-82-202
      , and public hearing, determine whether or not the project so proposed shall promote industry and develop trade to provide against low employment, and enter an order so finding.
  
  
    (3) On the issue of whether or not industry, trade and employment shall be so promoted and developed, the county mayor shall take into consideration the plants proposed to be served by the facilities for transmission of industrial chemicals by pipeline, but no project so proposed to be undertaken shall be found not to promote and develop industry, trade and employment for either of the following reasons:
    
      (A) That the project shall provide service for a single plant;  or
    
    
      (B) That the project shall serve to maintain existing industry and employment rather than encourage new industry and additional employment.
    
  
  
    (4) Any party in interest, including any subscriber to existing services of the district, shall have the right of appeal from the order as provided by

    (1) Where an agreement cannot be reached, the utility district, by a resolution setting out the area to be served and the type of utility, shall notify the city or town of its intention to serve the area;
  
  
    (2) After receipt of such notice, the city or town shall have sixty (60) days in which to adopt an appropriate ordinance or resolution determining to serve the area within a specified time.  The utility district may, within ten (10) days, appeal to the county mayor of the county in which the major part of the land area is located if it considers the time so determined is too long, whereupon the county mayor after hearing both parties, shall determine a reasonable time for the city or town to provide the services, and further appeal may be taken by either party as provided in 
§ 7-82-204
      ;  and
  
  
    (3) Upon failure of the city or town to provide the services within the time so determined, the utility district shall be authorized to serve any part of the area not already served by the city or town.
  

  
    (h)(1) A system or facilities for “the transmission of natural gas by pipeline,” as used in this section, means and includes facilities or a system used or useful in the transmission by pipeline of natural gas from one (1) or more wells or other sources of natural gas or from one (1) or more collection points of natural gas located within or without the district, but in no event more than five (5) miles beyond the boundary of the district, to one (1) or more utilities, plants or industries located within or without the district, but in no event more than one hundred (100) miles distant from the boundary of the district; provided, that a portion of the system or facilities shall be located within the boundary of the district.  Such system or facilities shall include, but not be limited to, pipelines, collection facilities, terminal facilities, rights-of-way and all real and personal property, including machinery and equipment, appurtenant to, or useful in connection with, such system or facilities.

§ 7-82-202
       and public hearing, determine either that the project so proposed shall promote commerce, preserve the natural resources, or aid in the prevention of environmental pollution, and enter an order so finding.
  
  
    (3) On the issue of whether or not such purpose or purposes shall be so promoted, preserved or aided, the county mayor shall take into consideration the utilities, plants or industries proposed to be served by the facilities for transmission of natural gas by pipeline, but no project so proposed to be undertaken shall be found not to promote commerce, preserve the natural resources, or aid in the prevention of environmental pollution for the reason that the project shall provide service for a single utility, plant or industry.
  
  
    (4) Any party in interest, including any subscriber to existing services of the district, shall have the right of appeal from the order as provided by 
§ 7-82-204
      , but no consent to the undertaking of such district services by any number of existing subscribers shall be required, notwithstanding

      (A) Prior to each election, the county election commission shall first assure that each optical scan tabulator used to count absentee by-mail ballots, early voting ballots and election day ballots have been cleaned of debris by the manufacturer.  The manufacturer shall provide the election commission with a certificate that attests to the cleaning of the tabulator prior to the election.  The certificate of any optical scan tabulator used during the automatic audit shall be made available to the public prior to the use of the optical scan tabulator in the audit process;
    
    
      (B) The county election commission shall randomly select at least one (1) precinct-based optical scan tabulator used to count ballots cast during early voting;

      (D) Before an optical scan tabulator may be used for the audit process, a printed tape of the election results must be generated and the electronic election results from the tabulator must be backed up onto a separate laptop.  The optical scan tabulator must be cleared and reset.  A zero tape from the optical scan tabulator must be printed before the tabulator may be used in the audit process.
    
  
  
    (2) Immediately after the polls close and at a place open to the public, the county election commission shall randomly select the voting precinct or precincts, as appropriate, and shall select at least one (1) precinct-based optical scan tabulator used to count ballots during early voting to be used for the automatic mandatory audit and shall announce to the public the results of the random drawing.  The random selection utilized by the county election commission shall ensure that all voting precincts in the county and all precinct-based optical scan tabulators used to count ballots cast during early voting have an equal chance of being selected.
  

  
    (b)(1) After the unofficial election results, excluding provisional ballots, have been determined and made public, a county election commissioner from the majority party and a county election commissioner from the minority party shall have all absentee by-mail ballots, all ballots cast during the early voting period and all ballots cast on election day locked and sealed pursuant to 
§ 2-6-311
       until the county election commission convenes to conduct the audit.  The county election commission shall also lock and secure each precinct-based optical scan tabulator used in the election process until the county election commission convenes to conduct the audit.

      (A) At a time and place open to the public, the county election commission shall identify those ballot boxes containing the absentee by-mail ballots cast in the randomly selected voting precinct or precincts and identify those ballot boxes containing the election day ballots cast in the randomly selected voting precinct or precincts.  The election commission must include in the audit only those absentee by-mail ballots which were counted by an optical scan tabulator rather than by hand.  A county election commissioner from the majority party and a county election commissioner from the minority party, personally holding the keys to such ballot box or boxes, shall unlock the ballot box or boxes;
    
    
      (B) The election commission shall identify and remove from the respective ballot box or boxes each ballot cast in the absentee by-mail voting process in the selected precincts which were counted by an optical scan tabulator and each ballot cast on election day in the selected precinct or precincts;
    
    
      
(C)(i) In auditing the precinct-based optical scan tabulator which had been used to originally count the early voting voter-verified paper ballots, the county election commission shall remove the early voting ballots contained in the ballot box of the optical scan tabulator and shall verify the accuracy of the unofficial election results by inserting such early voting ballots into the randomly selected optical scan tabulator.  The county election commission shall compare the results of the top race obtained during the automatic audit of such optical scan tabulator with the unofficial election results of the top race.  The election commission shall publicly announce the results;
      
      
(ii) In auditing the absentee by-mail ballots which were counted by an optical scan tabulator, the county election commission shall take the absentee by-mail ballots from the randomly selected voting precinct or precincts and shall verify the accuracy of the unofficial election results by inserting the subject absentee by-mail in a different precinct-based optical scan tabulator than that used to originally count the absentee ballots;
      
      
(iii) In auditing the election day ballots, the county election commission shall take the election day ballots from the randomly selected voting precinct or precincts and shall verify the accuracy of the unofficial election results by inserting the subject election day ballots in a different precinct-based optical scan tabulator than that used to originally count the election day ballots;
      
      
(iv) To judge the accuracy of the unofficial election results, the county election commission shall compare the results of the top race obtained during the automatic audit with the unofficial election results of the top race obtained on election night.  The election commission shall publicly announce the results;
      
    
    
      
(D)(i) If as a result of the automatic audit the county election commission finds that there is a variance of less than one percent (1%) between the unofficial election results of the top race and the automatic audit, no hand count audit shall be required and the county election commission shall certify the election results as originally determined;
      
      
(ii) If as a result of the automatic audit, the county election commission finds that there is a variance of more than one percent (1%) between the unofficial election results of the top race and the automatic audit, the county election commission shall randomly select at least three percent (3%) of the voting precincts in the county.  The county election commission may include the voting precincts previously audited.  The county election commission must identify the ballot box or boxes from the subject voting precincts, obtain the ballots out of those ballot boxes and then insert such ballots into a different optical scan tabulator than that used to originally count the ballots.  In addition, the county election commission may conduct a manual hand count of the same ballots subjected to the automatic audit described in this subdivision (b)(2)(D)(ii).  The automatic audit or the manual hand count audit, if one is conducted, shall be of the top race on the ballot in such voting precincts used in the expanded audit.  The county election commission shall publicly announce the results of the automatic audit and the manual hand count if a manual hand count is conducted;
      
      
(iii) The results of any difference between precinct-based optical scan tabulations or the hand count audit shall be available for use in any election contest filed pursuant to chapter 17 of this title."

  (f) In counties where a general sessions court system exists prior to consolidation, the charter may consolidate municipal and general sessions courts by providing that judges of the municipal court of the principal city may become judges of the general sessions court, and that the general sessions court, in addition to the jurisdiction and powers previously vested in the general sessions court, shall also be vested with all the jurisdiction and powers vested in the municipal court of the principal city of the county prior to the creation of the metropolitan government, and jurisdiction to hear, try and dispose of all cases arising under the laws, ordinances and resolutions of the metropolitan government.  It may also provide that jurisdiction and powers vested in the municipal courts of smaller cities that become a part of the urban services district at the time of the creation of a metropolitan government under chapters 1-3 of this title or that become a part of the metropolitan government later pursuant to

  (g) In any county having a metropolitan form of government and a population of less than thirty thousand (30,000), according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census, the judge of the general sessions court shall be considered as a part-time judge, and shall not be prohibited from the practice of law or other gainful employment while serving as judge, except to the extent such practice or employment constitutes a conflict of interest.

  
    (h)(1) The legislative body of any county that has adopted a metropolitan form of government may, by ordinance, create not more than two (2) additional divisions of general sessions court and not more than two (2) additional judges and other essential personnel to staff such divisions.
  
  
    (2) If the legislative body of such county creates such additional division or divisions, the judge or judges for the division or divisions shall be elected at the regular August election in 1998, and their term of eight (8) years shall begin on September 1, 1998.
  
  
    (3) If the legislative body desires the judge or judges of such new division or divisions to hear, primarily or exclusively, only certain types of cases, it shall so designate in the ordinance.  Otherwise, such new division or divisions shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the other courts of general sessions in such counties.
  
  
    (4) The judge or judges of such new division or divisions shall have the same powers and duties and shall receive the same compensation, payable in the same manner, as other general sessions judges in such county."

Regional Authorities § 64-8-206,"(a) The board shall develop a plan for the operation and expansion of mass transit services in the authority's region.  The plan shall be consistent with the multi-modal regional transportation plan adopted by the region's metropolitan planning organization or similar regional transportation planning body and be reflective of the transportation goals and objectives of the municipalities and counties located within the authority's area.  An authority shall work cooperatively with any state or federally mandated metropolitan planning organization having planning and programming powers in the authority's area to produce a regional transit plan.  It is not the intent of this section to establish or designate an authority as the metropolitan planning organization for any particular region.  The plan shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
  
    (1) A map and description of existing and proposed transit corridors;
  
  
    (2) A map and description of areas to be served;
  
  
    (3) A description of the frequency and method of providing existing and proposed transit services in those areas;
  
  
    (4) A description of how regional services will be coordinated with local public and private transportation operators and agencies;
  
  
    (5) A description of how existing and proposed regional services will be funded, including a plan to coordinate contributions from public and private sources throughout the region;
  
  
    (6) A description of how the regional transportation authority plans to deliver service, either directly or through contract, agreement or some other method, with other public or private transportation agencies or other entities;
  
  
    (7) A provision for the conduct of special services for disabled persons or other persons unable to use regularly scheduled and equipped services sufficient to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, compiled in 
42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.
      ;
  
  
    (8) A provision of services for special events or occasions;
  
  
    (9) A description for how the regional transportation authority intends to use its property around existing and proposed transit stations to encourage ridership and to support local community goals for quality growth.  The description shall include an overview of any intent of the authority to pursue transit oriented development or transit adjacent development plans, or both, in cooperation with local governments and within local zoning regulations and land use policies.  It is the legislative intent to allow the authority to negotiate with private developers or other public agencies for the best use of land owned or leased by the authority, including long-term land leases or subleases, or the development of office, retail, or residential establishments, or any of these, on transit district property to generate transit ridership and to support local and regional economic growth;  and
  
  
    (10) Any other provisions necessary or desirable to establish a coordinated, reliable, scheduled regional service.
  

  (b) In addition to the powers to plan for mass transit services, the authority shall have the following additional powers and duties in order to implement its plans for mass transit and other transportation services and plans for transit adjacent and transit oriented development:
  
    (1) To organize itself into a public body, elect officers and adopt bylaws for the purpose of carrying out the functions authorized by this part;
  
  
    (2) To sue and be sued in its name with any causes of action against the authority or recovery against the authority governed by and subject to the limitations imposed by the Governmental Tort Liability Act, compiled in title 29, chapter 20.  No claim may be brought or judgment entered against any metropolitan government, municipality or county that creates or joins an authority for the acts or omissions of the authority;
  
  
    (3) To enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with governmental, not-for-profit and for-profit entities;
  
  
    (4) To purchase, own, lease and dispose of real and personal property, and construct buildings and other structures, in furtherance of the purposes of and the implementation of the authority's transit and transportation plans and plans for transit adjacent and transit oriented development.  The authority shall comply with all local land use and land development laws and regulations, including zoning ordinances and resolutions, subdivision regulations and building codes, in the implementation of the authority's plans.  Local governments may waive all or part of applicable local laws and regulations to assist the authority in plan implementation;
  
  
    (5) To employ personnel or contract with public or private entities to construct or operate transportation and transit services and to participate in the development of transit adjacent and transit oriented developments.  An authority shall not operate local transit services in an area already receiving those services without the consent of the local governing body of that area;
  
  
    (6) To employ or contract for professional services, such as, but not limited to, management, planning, support, engineering, legal, accounting and auditing services;
  
  
    (7) To utilize for transit or transportation services any property, right-of-way, easement or other similar property owned or held by the state or any municipality, county or metropolitan government or federal government department or agency within the transportation service area of the authority that may be necessary and convenient for the implementation of the authority's transit and transportation plans so long as the governmental entity owning or controlling such property shall consent to the authority's use;
  
  
    (8) To establish local assessments for the purposes of paying expenses related to the administration of the authority's activities, including, but not limited to, the costs associated with insurance policies and deductibles, to be paid by its city, town, metropolitan government and county government members.  Local assessments shall not be used for the construction or operation of transportation facilities or services.  The local assessment shall be based on a per capita and a flat rate.  In establishing the per capita assessment, the authority shall use the population figures of the latest census as described for the use of development districts in 
§ 13-14-111(d)
      .  For any regional transportation authority created under this part, the per capita assessment shall be established by a majority vote of the governing board, but shall not be less than ten cents (10¢) per capita.  For the purpose of calculating the assessment for any county or metropolitan government, the population of any town or city located wholly or partly within the county, or the towns or cities within the geographic boundary of the metropolitan government, but that are not a part of the metropolitan government, shall not be included in the population of the county or metropolitan government.  The authority's local assessment shall be imposed on October 1 of each calendar year, and the member government shall pay either the per capita rate or the flat assessment, whichever is greater.  Failure of a city, town, metropolitan or county government to pay the assessment shall result in the loss of that government's participation in the governance and benefits of the authority;
  
  
    (9) To impose fees for the services provided by the authority;
  
  
    (10) To accept grant funds from the state or federal government, subject to the approval, restrictions and requirements of the state or federal government grantor and to accept contributions or donations from other public or private entities.  Metropolitan governments, counties, cities and towns may provide, and the authority may accept, funds from any source allowable by law and not prohibited by the Tennessee constitution.  The authority shall not claim any federal or state grants used to provide local transit services awarded to a local transit operator or local government without the consent of the local government or governments.  Such restriction shall not prohibit a metropolitan planning organization, the governor or other grantor from allocating or programming funds to transportation projects as required by federal law;  and
  
  
    (11) To borrow money in order to proceed with or finish the construction of mass transit or other transportation services or to fund the operations and capital cost of such services and purchase of real property and the construction of infrastructure and improvements or contract for the construction of the infrastructure and improvements to implement the authority's plans.  The authority may enter into a security agreement pledging, as appropriate, to secure the loan with:
    
      (A) Anticipated forthcoming grants from the state or federal government, subject to the approval, restrictions and requirements of the state or federal government grantor;  provided, however, that such approval must be reauthorized if the funds are not received within one (1) year of the initial approval;
    
    
      (B) Anticipated assessments from local governments pursuant to subdivision (b)(8);
    
    
      (C) The authority's real or personal property;  or
    
    
      (D) Other revenues.
    
  

  (c) The implementation of the authority's transit and transportation plans and plans for transit adjacent and transit oriented development will necessitate the acquisition, construction, operation and maintenance of properties, facilities and equipment and the employment of personnel or contracting for services, all of which the authority is authorized to undertake and accomplish and all of which are declared and deemed to be for public and governmental functions conducted by the authority.  The authority is a public body corporate and politic and all powers and duties granted by this part are and shall be declared public and corporate purposes and matters of public necessity."

§ 7-82-204
      .
  
  
    (2) Upon receipt of such petition, it is the duty of the county mayor to fix a time and place for a public hearing upon the convenience and necessity of the incorporation of the district to perform the services stated in the petition.  The date of such hearing shall be not more than thirty (30) days after the receipt of the petition and its date, place and purpose shall be announced by the county mayor in a notice published not more than fifteen (15) days nor less than seven (7) days prior to the date of the hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed district, or if there be no such newspaper, then by posting such notice in five (5) conspicuous public places within the boundaries of the proposed district.  If the boundaries of the proposed district include territory within five (5) miles of a city or town having a population of five thousand (5,000) or more, within three (3) miles of a city or town having a population of less than five thousand (5,000), or within three (3) miles of any water, sewerage or gas service facility of a county, city, town or utility district, notice by registered mail of the hearing, its purpose, date and place and the boundaries of the proposed district shall be given the mayor or chief executive officer of such county, city, town, and utility district at least ten (10) days before the hearing.  The county mayor shall read the final comments of the board to persons at the public hearing and make copies available if requested by those in attendance.

    , to determine the time.  If the existing utility district or city or town fails to provide the services within the time so determined, the county mayor, unless the county mayor decides that circumstances warrant an extension of time, may create the utility district, acting on the original petition, to serve such area as the county mayor decides it can reasonably be expected to serve.  If no existing utility district or city or town presents such plans to the county mayor within the sixty (60) days, the petition shall be acted upon as otherwise provided by law.

  (c) Should a city or town exercise its prior right, as herein provided, to serve areas adjoining its boundaries within five (5) miles of a municipality of five thousand (5,000) or more in population or within three (3) miles of a municipality of less than five thousand (5,000) in population, the county mayor shall excise such areas from the boundaries of the proposed district, or strike from the petition and omit from the order the authority of the district to perform the service or services in such areas.

  (d) Upon the creation or recreation of any utility district as provided for in this chapter, the president of the utility district shall file with the secretary of state, the utility management review board and with the register of deeds of the county or counties wherein the district is located, a true and correct copy of the order creating the utility district.  The secretary of state shall maintain and keep a book for recording orders creating utility districts and all fees in connection with the recordings shall be paid by the district.  Any amendments whatsoever to such order creating the utility district or any order merging, consolidating or re-creating a utility district shall be filed in like manner.  The failure to so file a copy of such order or orders is a Class C misdemeanor.  Whenever two (2) or more utility districts, individually located in counties having a population of not less than thirty-six thousand nine hundred ninety-five (36,995) and not more than thirty-seven thousand five (37,005) or not less than fifty-nine thousand four hundred twenty-five (59,425) nor more than fifty-nine thousand four hundred thirty (59,430), according to the 1970 federal census or any subsequent federal census, or any county having a metropolitan form of government, by resolution of the respective governing bodies of such utility districts, concur in the contraction of the territory served by one (1) of the utility districts in one (1) county and corresponding expansion of the territory served by the other utility district in another county into the county served by the contracting district, the respective utility districts shall petition the county mayor of the county wherein the utility district was created for an order permitting such modification of territory, if such modification shall result in greater efficiency and convenience in the furnishing of the services authorized by the order of creation. Upon being so petitioned, and upon entering an order modifying the boundaries of such district, the county mayor shall proceed in the manner provided in this subsection (d) and may, at such time, waive 
      §§ 7-82-602
     and 
      7-82-607
    , relative to selection and appointment of commissioners in such territory so waived and thereby invoke 
      § 7-82-307
    , relative to selection and appointment of commissioners in such territory, so that the commissioners so selected in the resulting multi-county districts are selected pursuant to 
      § 7-82-307
     pertaining only to single county districts.

  
    
      (e)(1)(A) Whenever two (2) or more utility districts by resolution adopted by the respective governing bodies concur in a merger or consolidation of such utility districts, or whenever a utility district by resolution of its governing body agrees or proposes to consolidate with a municipality or a county by transferring all of its property and obligations to the municipality or county, the governing body or bodies shall petition the county mayor of the county or counties in which they were created, or in case of multi-county utility districts, the county mayor of any county in which they are situated in whole or in part, for an order permitting the merger, consolidation or transfer of its franchise facilities, assets and obligations to a municipality or a county for the purpose of more efficiently and conveniently furnishing the service or services authorized by their order of creation.  Upon the petition being filed, the county mayor or mayors shall proceed in exactly the same manner as provided in this chapter for the creation of a utility district, except as set forth in subsection (g).
    
    
      (B) Upon a finding that the public convenience and necessity requires the merger or consolidation of two (2) or more utility districts or the transfer of any utility district into a municipality or county and that the merger, consolidation or transfer is economically sound and feasible and in the public interest, an order shall be entered approving the merger, consolidation or transfer of the utility district or districts.
      
(i) If the petition is for a merger, the order shall designate the surviving utility district, and the boundaries of the surviving utility district shall be the boundaries of the merging utility districts.  The members of the board of commissioners of the surviving utility district shall continue to serve their existing terms of office subject to subdivision (e)(2).
      
      
(ii) If the petition is for a consolidation of utility districts, the order shall designate the name of the newly created consolidated utility district as the ____________________ Utility District of ____________________ County or Counties, Tennessee, shall define its territorial limits and shall appoint the commissioners of the utility district, all in accordance with the requirements of this chapter for the creation of a utility district subject to subdivision (e)(2).
      
      
(iii) If the petition is for the transfer of all franchises, assets and liabilities to a municipality or a county, then the utility district shall be dissolved and provision made in the order for an equitable distribution of the assets and for the termination of the existence of the utility district and shall establish the legal rights, duties and obligations of the entities and parties involved.
      
      
(iv) The order shall provide that the surviving utility district in a merger, the newly consolidated utility district or the municipality or county to which a transfer is made shall assume the operation of the system or systems then being merged, consolidated or transferred and shall account for the revenues from the system or systems in such a manner as not to impair the obligations of the contract with reference to bond issues or other legal obligations of the utility district or districts, and shall fully preserve and protect the contract rights vested in the owners of the outstanding bonds, obligations or contractual interests.
      
    
  
  
    (2) Notwithstanding this section or any other law to the contrary, two (2) or more utility districts, each of which has a board of three (3) commissioners, that concur in a merger or consolidation of such utility districts may by agreement increase the size of the board of commissioners of the merged or consolidated utility district to five (5) commissioners in accordance with the requirements of this subsection (e).  The merging or consolidating utility districts that agree to increase the size of the board of commissioners to five (5) commissioners shall include the agreement in their respective resolutions concurring in the merger or consolidation and shall state such agreement in the petition for merger or consolidation submitted to the county mayor.  The petition for merger or consolidation shall name in the petition up to five (5) individuals to serve as commissioners for the merged or consolidated utility district proposed by such petition, each of whom shall be an existing commissioner of one (1) of the utility districts proposing to merge or consolidate and shall be qualified to serve in accordance with 
§ 7-82-308(d)
      .  The county mayor or mayors conducting the hearing on the petition for merger or consolidation shall appoint such individuals, named in the petition for merger or consolidation, as commissioners for the merged or consolidated utility district, unless the county mayor or mayors find such individuals are not qualified to serve as commissioners under 
§ 7-82-308(d)
      .  If the merging or consolidating utility districts do not name five (5) individuals who are qualified to serve as commissioners under 
§ 7-82-308(d)
       for the merged or consolidated utility district in the petition for merger or consolidation, then the county mayor or mayors shall appoint a sufficient number of individuals who are qualified under 
§ 7-82-308(d)
       to serve as commissioners for any seats not named by the merging or consolidating utility districts in the petition.  The county mayor or mayors shall appoint one (1) commissioner for an initial two-year term, two (2) commissioners for initial three-year terms and two (2) commissioners for initial four-year terms.
  
  
    (3) Notwithstanding this section or any other law to the contrary, four (4) or more utility districts, each of which has a board of three (3) commissioners, that concur in a merger or consolidation of such utility districts may by agreement increase the size of the board of commissioners of the merged or consolidated utility district to seven (7) commissioners in accordance with the requirements of subdivision (e)(2).  The county mayor or mayors shall appoint two (2) commissioners for initial two-year terms, two (2) commissioners for initial three-year terms and three (3) commissioners for initial four-year terms.
  

  (f) A municipality may acquire a utility district to be operated as a department separate from any other municipal utility.  Whenever a utility district by resolution adopted by its governing body agrees or proposes to consolidate with a municipality as a separate department of such municipality by transferring all of its property and obligations to such municipality, it shall petition the county mayor of the county in which it was created for an order approving the resolution to permit such consolidation, merger, acquisition or transfer of its franchise facilities, assets and obligations to a municipal corporation for the purpose of more efficiently and conveniently furnishing the service or services authorized by its order of creation.  Upon such petition being filed, such county mayor shall proceed in exactly the same manner as provided in this chapter for the creation of a utility district, and upon a finding that the public convenience and necessity requires consolidation, merger, acquisition or transfer and that the same is economically sound and feasible and in the public interest, an order shall be entered approving such resolution.  Upon the approval of such resolution by order of the county mayor, such utility district shall be dissolved and the assets, obligations, legal rights and duties of such district shall become those of the department of the municipality.  Such order shall provide that the department of the municipality shall assume the operation of the utility system and account for the revenues from the system in such a manner as not to impair the obligations of contract with reference to bond issues or other legal obligations of the district, and shall fully preserve and protect the contract rights vested in the owners of such outstanding bonds, obligations or contractual interests.  Such department of the municipality shall be operated separately from any other utility department of the municipality.  The governing body of the municipality shall be the governing board of such department and shall appoint an advisory committee on utilities if the area served by the utility district is outside the boundaries of the municipality.  The governing body of the municipality shall, by ordinance, create such advisory committee to be composed of either former utility district commissioners or residents and customers of the utility system so acquired.  The advisory committee members shall be appointed by the governing body of the municipality in the number and for the term specified by the ordinance.  When the former utility district ceases to be a separate department and is merged with the other utility services of the municipality into one (1) utility system, such advisory committee may be dissolved.  No portion of such utility district shall be made a part of a municipal utility service without consideration being paid to the department composed of such utility district.

  (g) Petitions for a merger or consolidation of utility districts or for a consolidation of a utility district with a municipality or county under subsections (e) and (f) shall be filed with the utility management review board simultaneously with the filing of the petition with the county mayor or mayors under subsections (e) and (f).  Such petitions are not subject to approval or disapproval by the utility management review board as set forth in 
      § 7-82-201(a)
     and 
      subsection (a)
     and are not subject to approval by the county legislative body or bodies as set forth in subdivision (a)(3)(B).

  (h) Petitions for re-creation of a utility district for the purpose of redefining its incorporated boundary shall be filed with the utility management review board simultaneously with the filing of the petition with the county mayor or mayors.  Such petitions are not subject to approval or disapproval by the utility management review board as set forth in 
      § 7-82-201 (a)
     and 
      subsection (a)
     and are not subject to approval by the county legislative body or bodies as set forth in subdivision (a)(3)(B)."

    (1) Real property shall not be sold in fee, and any interest or rights in minerals, coal, natural gas, oil, timber and any other energy related resources shall not be conveyed if there is any feasible use for the property by any state agency, as determined by the governor, the attorney general and reporter and the commissioner of general services.  Should the state agency have an approved use for the property, the commissioner is authorized to transfer jurisdiction to the appropriate agency at no cost;
  
  
    (2) As to sales in fee, and to any conveyance of any interest or rights in minerals, coal, natural gas, oil, timber and any other energy-related resources, such property shall be appraised by at least two (2) independent, qualified appraisers, wholly disconnected from state government or any other legal governmental entity except as may otherwise be determined by the state building commission;
  
  
    (3) As to sales in fee, and to any conveyance of any interest or rights in minerals, coal, natural gas, oil, timber and any other energy-related resources, such surplus property having an average appraised value exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) shall be advertised not less than one (1) time in a newspaper which is local with respect to the property to be sold and once in a newspaper in either Nashville, Memphis, Chattanooga or Knoxville, whichever is nearest by air;  provided, that if one (1) of these four (4) cities is the situs of the property to be sold, advertisement shall be made twice within a two-week period.  Any interest or rights in minerals, coal, natural gas, oil, timber and any other energy-related resources shall be sold by the sealed bid method with the condition that the state shall have the right to refuse any and all bids.  Fee interests in real property shall be sold by the sealed bid method or by public auction in accordance with policies established by the state building commission, with the condition that the state shall have the rights to refuse any and all bids.  As used in this subdivision (a)(3), “public auction” may include, without limitation, Internet auctions and in-person auctions so long as such auctions are open for participation by the public at large.  Upon the approval of the governor, the attorney general and reporter, and the commissioner, the successful bidder will be notified of the intent to award within a period of forty-five (45) days commencing from the date of bid openings;
  
  
    (4) All interests in real property other than the fee interest, including, but not limited to, leases, easements and rights-of-way, shall be disposed of in accordance with policies established by the state building commission, including advertisement and appraisal where deemed appropriate by the state building commission;  provided, however, that, if the property was acquired by or for the use of the department of transportation for right-of-way, then the department of transportation may convey the interests in the property by negotiated sale or disposal to any legal governmental body for a public use purpose, subject to reversion to the department of transportation for failure to continue public ownership and use, or to the former owner or an adjoining owner for fair market value, in accordance with procedures established in subdivision (a)(8).  If approved by the department of transportation, and the federal highway administration where required by federal law, a functional replacement of real property may be considered to continue public ownership and use, and shall not be subject to reversion to the department of transportation, if the replacement property is at least equal in fair market value to the property being replaced.  For the purposes of this subdivision (a)(4), a functional replacement of real property means real property that serves the same function as the real property conveyed by the state by providing equivalent utility, as determined by the department of transportation, and the federal highway administration where required by federal law.  The fair market value of the replacement property shall be determined in accordance with the procedures for determining the fair market value of the surplus property established in subdivision (a)(8).  This subdivision (a)(4) shall not apply to the disposal or conveyance in any manner of any interest or rights in minerals, coal, natural gas, oil, timber and any other energy related resources;  provided, that the commission shall have authority to promulgate rules and regulations over the disposal or conveyances pursuant to the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5;

      (8)(A) If the property was acquired by or for the use of the department of transportation for right-of-way, if its fair market value does not exceed seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) or such amounts in excess of seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) as may be approved by the state building commission, and if any adjoining property owner or the former owner of that property wishes to purchase the property, or if a legal governmental body wishes to acquire the property for a public use purpose, then this section shall not apply.  Instead, the commissioner of transportation is authorized to declare the property surplus if the commissioner determines that the purpose of its acquisition has been completed and that the property is no longer needed by the department of transportation or another state agency, and may sell it to any adjoining property owner or the former owner of that property, for an amount representing not less than the fair market value, together with costs;  provided, however, that the department of transportation may convey the property or any interest in the property by negotiated sale or disposal to any legal governmental body for a public use purpose, subject to reversion to the department of transportation for failure to continue public ownership and use.  If approved by the department of transportation, and the federal highway administration where required by federal law, the department of transportation may accept real property in exchange for the surplus real property conveyed if the replacement property is at least equal in fair market value to the surplus property being replaced.  The fair market value of the replacement property shall be determined in accordance with the procedures for determining the fair market value of the surplus property established in this subdivision (a)(8).  The commissioner of general services shall concur in the fair market value amount or in the negotiated sale or disposal of the property to a legal governmental body for a public use purpose.  If in the judgment of the department of transportation a survey of the property is required, the prospective purchaser shall pay the department of transportation in advance for the cost of the survey;
    
    
      (B) The former property owner's right shall terminate ten (10) years after the date of acquisition by the department of transportation by conveyance or date of taking in condemnation of the subject property by the department.  The former property owner's right shall not transfer to the owner's heirs.  The former property owner shall have first right of refusal to purchase the right-of-way;  provided, however, that the department may convey the property or any interest in the property to a legal governmental body for a public use purpose, subject to reversion to the department of transportation for failure to continue public ownership and use, without offering the former owner a first right of refusal to purchase the property.  If the former property owner relinquishes the owner's right or the right has expired, the property may be conveyed to an adjoining property owner.  If more than one (1) adjoining property owner is interested in purchasing the right-of-way, the interested adjoining property owners shall submit sealed bids to the department of transportation, with the minimum bid price being the fair market value determined by appraisal, and the property may be conveyed to the adjoining property owner offering the highest responsive bid.  The successful bidder shall reimburse any unsuccessful prospective purchaser for survey and appraisal costs incurred in accordance with the requirements of this subdivision (a)(8);
    
    
      (C) For the purposes of this subdivision (a)(8), the fair market value of surplus right-of-way property shall be determined in accordance with the following procedures:
      
(i) The department of transportation shall make a preliminary planning estimate of the fair market value of the property in accordance with procedures that the department may establish;
      
      
(ii) If the department of transportation's preliminary planning estimate of the fair market value of the property is ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, the property shall be appraised by an appraiser on staff with the department of transportation at no cost to the prospective purchaser;
      
      
(iii) If the department of transportation's preliminary planning estimate or subsequent staff appraisal of the fair market value of the property is greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the property shall be appraised by an independent appraiser whose services shall be procured by the department of transportation in accordance with state law.  The independent appraiser must be licensed and certified by the Tennessee real estate appraiser commission and shall be selected from a list of prequalified appraisers approved by the department of transportation.  The prospective purchaser shall pay the department of transportation in advance for the cost of the independent appraisal;
      
      
(iv) The initial appraisal shall be subject to review and approval by the department of transportation in accordance with procedures that the department of transportation may establish.  The appraisal review shall be conducted, at the department of transportation's expense, by a review appraiser who is licensed and certified by the Tennessee real estate appraiser commission and who is either employed by or under contract with the department of transportation.  The review appraiser shall either approve the initial appraisal or reject the initial appraisal and reappraise the property to determine the fair market value of the property, subject to the approval of the director of the right-of-way division of the department of transportation or the director's designee.  If approved by the director or the director's designee, the review appraiser's determination shall be presented to a prospective purchaser as the fair market value of the property;
      
      
(v) If a prospective purchaser does not accept the appraised fair market value of the property as determined by the review appraiser, the prospective purchaser may request a final review and reconsideration by the commissioner of transportation or the commissioner's designee.  The commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall obtain a final review of the appraisal by a review appraiser who is licensed and certified by the Tennessee real estate appraiser commission and who is either employed by or under contract with the department of transportation;  provided, however, that the final review appraiser shall not be the same person who previously reviewed the initial appraisal.  The prospective purchaser shall be given the opportunity to present information concerning the value of the property for the consideration of the final review appraiser.  The final review appraiser shall consider all relevant information, including any appraisal previously performed by or for the department of transportation, and shall have the authority to reappraise or make adjustments in the appraised fair market value, in accordance with generally accepted professional standards and guidelines.  The final review appraiser's determination of the fair market value of the property shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner or the commissioner's designee;  and
      
      
(vi) The department's final determination of the fair market value of the property is subject to the concurrence of the commissioner of general services;
      
    
  
  
    (9) If property acquired by the department of transportation for a right-of-way through the exercise of eminent domain or otherwise is determined by the commissioner of transportation to be no longer needed by the department of transportation, and the excess property is not transferred to another state agency or conveyed to some other legal governmental body as provided in this section, and the excess property is not disposed of in accordance with subdivision (a)(8), the excess property shall be disposed of by the department of general services in accordance with the following procedures:
    
      (A) The excess property shall be sold to any adjoining property owner or the former owner of that property at fair market value.  All funds collected from the sale of the property shall be paid into the highway fund, as provided in subdivision (a)(7);
    
    
      (B) The costs associated with the conveyance of the land, including, but not limited to, the cost of appraising and surveying the property, shall be reimbursed to the state by the purchaser of the property;
    
    
      (C) Any conveyance of the property made pursuant to this subsection (a) shall be subject to approval in advance by the state building commission;
    
    
      (D) If no adjoining property owner or the former owner of that property is able and willing to purchase the excess property at fair market value, then the excess property may be disposed of in accordance with existing statutes;
    
    
      (E) For the purposes of this subsection (a), the fair market value of the excess property shall initially be determined by the state through procedures established by the state building commission.  If such initial determination of fair market value is deemed unacceptable by the intended purchaser, the fair market value of the excess property shall then be determined by averaging the state's initial determination of fair market value with two (2) additional fair market value appraisals of the excess property.  The two (2) additional appraisals shall be performed by two (2) nonassociated appraisers from the locality in which the property is located.  The two (2) appraisers shall be mutually agreed upon by the parties to the conveyance;  none of the appraisers involved shall have any personal or financial interest in the conveyance;
    
    
      (F) The former property owner's right shall terminate ten (10) years after the date of acquisition by the department of transportation by conveyance or date of taking in condemnation of the subject property by the department.  The former property owner's right shall not transfer to such owner's heirs.  The former property owner shall have the first right of refusal to purchase the right-of-way.  If the former property owner relinquishes such owner's right, the adjoining property owners interested in purchasing the right-of-way shall submit sealed bids with the minimum bid price being the fair market value determined by appraisal;
    
    
      (G) If approved by the department of transportation, and the federal highway administration where required by federal law, the department of general services may accept real property in exchange for the excess real property conveyed if the replacement property is at least equal in fair market value to the excess property being replaced.  The fair market value of the replacement property shall be determined in accordance with the procedures for determining the fair market value of the excess property established in this subdivision (a)(9);
    
  
  
    (10) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, any funds collected from the lease of surplus state real property for communications relay apparatus or antennae sites that would otherwise be paid into the general fund of the state pursuant to subdivision (a)(7) shall be specifically earmarked for maintenance of state park facilities, including furniture, fixtures and equipment.  Any such funds that are unencumbered or unexpended at the end of any fiscal year shall not revert to the state general fund, but shall be carried forward until expended for the purposes stated in this section;
  
  
    
      (11)(A) Notwithstanding subdivision (a)(9) or any other law to the contrary, when and if the state transfers to the local government in which any tract or combination of tracts of property which are contiguous to one another and exceed twenty (20) acres in size and which were acquired by the department of transportation as part of an uncompleted and cancelled interstate and defense highway right-of-way in a county with a population in excess of eight hundred thousand (800,000), according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal census, is located, the transfer shall be subject to final approval by the state building commission and shall only be used for redevelopment pursuant to subdivision (a)(11)(B).

  (b) The commissioner of general services shall notify the house of representatives and senate member or members from the district in which the property to be sold or conveyed is located, and the notification shall be at least twenty (20) days prior to the agreement of sale or conveyance.

      (b)(1)(A) Upon the petition of at least twenty percent (20%) of the customers of a utility district to the utility management review board requesting the removal of a member or members of the utility district board of commissioners, the board shall conduct a contested case hearing on the question of whether such member or members should be removed from office and a new member or members appointed or elected.  To be considered by the board, the customer or customers initiating the petition must file a letter of intent to compile and file the petition with the board before the petition is signed.  All signatures of customers on the petition must have been obtained within ninety (90) days of the date the notice of intent to compile and file petition is filed with the board.  The petition must contain the genuine signatures of the customers of the utility district.  All information submitted in the petition must be legible.  Each customer signing the petition shall include the address at which the customer receives utility service and the date the customer signed the petition.  Upon receipt of the petition, the board shall verify the names and addresses of the signers of the petition to ensure that they are bona fide customers of the utility district and to ensure that all signatures have been obtained within ninety (90) days of the date the notice of intent to compile and file petition is filed with the board.  As used in this subdivision (b)(1), “customer” means a person who receives a bill for utility services and pays money for such services.  Each utility account shall be entitled to one (1) signature, but no person shall sign the petition more than once.  Only one petition to remove a utility district commissioner under this section can be filed in any twelve-month period.
    
    
      (B) Upon filing the petition as provided in this subdivision (b)(1), the petitioners shall also file a cash bond or attorney or corporate surety bond in the sum of three hundred fifty dollars ($350);  the bond being made payable to the state of Tennessee.  Such bond shall be for the costs of hearing and processing the petition.  The bond may be refunded if the utility management review board determines that the member or members of the utility district board of commissioners that are the subject of the petition should be removed;  in such instance the cost of the hearing shall be assessed against the district.  The administrative judge may assess additional costs against either the petitioners or the district, in accordance with this subdivision (b)(1)(B), to cover the total cost of the hearing.
    
    
      (C) For purposes of this subdivision (b)(1), “genuine signatures” means written, original signatures and excludes facsimile and electronic signatures of any kind.
    
  
  
    
      (2)(A) If the comptroller of the treasury investigates or conducts an audit of a utility district, the comptroller shall forward to the utility management review board any published investigative audit reports involving a utility district incorporated under this chapter.  The board shall review those reports and may conduct a contested case hearing on the question of whether utility district commissioners should be removed from office for knowingly or willfully committing misconduct in office, knowingly or willfully neglecting to fulfill any duty imposed upon the member by law, or failing to fulfill the commissioner’s or commissioners’ fiduciary responsibility in the operation or oversight of the district.
    
    
      (B) If the board concludes the member or members of the utility district board of commissioners has knowingly or willfully committed misconduct in office or has knowingly or willfully neglected to perform any duty imposed upon such member by law, or failed to fulfill the commissioner’s or commissioners’ fiduciary responsibility in the operation or oversight of the district, then the board shall issue an order removing such member from office.  Any vacancy on the board of commissioners shall then be filled by the selection method used by the utility district to fill vacancies; provided, that no member of the board of commissioners ousted by order of the board shall be eligible for reappointment, reelection, or to participate in either the nomination, appointment or election of new members by the board of commissioners.
    
  
  
    
      
(3)(A)(i) If a utility district is under the jurisdiction of the utility management review board pursuant to 
    § 7-82-701(a)
  , then the utility management review board may initiate a contested case hearing on the question of whether a member or members of the board of commissioners of the utility district should be removed from office and a new member or members appointed or elected on the grounds that either:

  (a) The utility district failed to comply with an order of the utility management review board, which shall include failing to comply with an order concerning excessive water losses;


  (b) A member or members failed to fulfill the commissioner’s or commissioners’ fiduciary responsibility in the operation or oversight of the district;  or


  (c) A member or members of the board of commissioners of the utility district committed misconduct in connection with such office or failed to perform any duty imposed by law on such office, including taking appropriate actions pursuant to 
      § 7-82-709(b)
     to reduce water loss to an acceptable level as determined by the board.

      
      
(ii) Failure of a member to vote in favor of a rate structure prescribed by the utility management review board that has been adopted by the utility district does not in itself constitute grounds for removal.
      
    
    
      (B) If the utility management review board concludes a member or members of the board of commissioners of the utility district should be removed from office for failure to comply with an order of the utility management review board or should be removed from office for committing misconduct in connection with such office or failing to perform any duty imposed by law, then the utility management review board shall issue an order removing such member or members from office.  Any vacancy on the board of commissioners shall then be filled by the selection method used by the utility district to fill vacancies;  provided, that no member of the board of commissioners ousted by order of the utility management review board shall be eligible for reappointment or reelection or shall participate in either the nomination, appointment or election of new members by the board of commissioners.
    
    
      (C) This subdivision (b)(3) shall not be construed as limiting any civil or criminal liability of any such member of the board of commissioners or the applicability of the ouster law, compiled in title 8, chapter 47.
    
  
  
    (4) When the member of a utility district board of commissioners is absent from four (4) consecutive regular board meetings or from one half ( 1/2 ) or more of the regular board meetings in a calendar year, the utility district shall report such absenteeism in writing to the county mayor of the county in which the utility district commissioner resides or is a customer and to the county mayor of the county in which the utility district's principal office is located, if different.  The utility district's written report of absenteeism shall be sent to the county mayor or mayors within thirty (30) days after:
    
      (A) The fourth consecutive unattended board meeting;  or
    
    
      (B) The end of the calendar year in which one half ( 1/2 ) or more of the regular board meetings were not attended, with a copy of such written report sent to the utility district commissioner, all such reports to be sent by certified mail.
    
  
  
    (5) A utility district commissioner who fails to meet the training and continuing education requirements set forth in 
§ 7-82-308(h) or (i)
       before the end of the commissioner's term of office shall not be eligible for reappointment or reelection to another term of office.  For the purposes of this subdivision (b)(5) , the continuing education period used to determine whether a utility district commissioner has met the training and continuing education requirements set forth in 
§ 7-82-308(h) or (i)
       shall be the last full continuing education period before the utility district commissioner's term of office ends.
  

  (c) When the utility management review board reviews the audited annual financial report and operations of a financially distressed utility district pursuant to 
      § 7-82-703
    , and the utility district fills vacancies on its board of commissioners by a method other than appointment by a county mayor or mayors, the board may elect to hold a public hearing on the issue of whether the method of filling vacancies on the district's board should be changed.  If the board elects to hold a public hearing, then the board shall conduct a contested case hearing on this issue.  If the board finds that it is in the best interest of the public served by the utility district that the method of filling vacancies on the utility district's board be changed, then the board shall enter an order that provides that all future vacancies on the utility district board shall be filled by appointment of the county mayor or mayors pursuant to the procedures set forth in subdivisions (a)(4) and (5).

  (d) Notwithstanding this section to the contrary, if a utility district board of commissioners fails to undertake the necessary actions as prescribed in this section to provide for the appointment or election of a new commissioner to take office upon the expiration of a term or fill a vacancy that may occur for any reason within the period of time set forth in this section, then the county mayor of the county in which such utility district was incorporated shall have the power and responsibility to make an interim appointment to such board of commissioners until such time as the proper actions required pursuant to this section have been undertaken.

  (e) In implementing this section, the appointing and electing authorities that fill vacancies on utility district boards of commissioners shall give due consideration to the need for racial, gender, age and ethnic minority diversity on utility district boards of commissioners.

  (f) Immediately upon indictment for misconduct in office, the indicted utility district commissioner shall be suspended from office pending the final disposition of the criminal proceeding or until the expiration of the commissioner's term of office, whichever occurs first.  While suspended, an indicted commissioner shall be ineligible to receive any payments or benefits as provided in 
      § 7-82-308(a)
    .  In a single county utility district, the county mayor of that county shall have the power and responsibility to make an interim appointment to fill the vacancy created by the suspension from office.  In a multi-county utility district, the county mayor of the county in which the indicted utility district commissioner resides or is a customer shall have the power and responsibility to make an interim appointment to fill the vacancy created by the suspension from office.  If the criminal proceeding against the suspended utility district commissioner has not terminated by the expiration of the term, the office will be considered vacant and be filled as provided by law.  If the criminal proceeding is terminated with a finding or verdict of guilty on any of the charges on which the commissioner was indicted, then the suspension shall be made permanent, the office will be considered vacant, and the interim appointee shall serve until the office is filled as provided by law.  If the criminal proceeding against the suspended utility district commissioner related to the indictment for misconduct in office is terminated by any finding, adjudication or deferral of the proceedings, including a not guilty verdict or a dismissal on the merit, the suspension of the utility district commissioner shall be removed, and the commissioner shall become eligible to serve the commissioner’s office;  simultaneously the county mayor's interim appointee shall cease to hold office.

  
    (g)(1) Notwithstanding this section or any other law to the contrary, any water utility district having less than one thousand six hundred (1,600) customers in any county having a population of not less than thirty-nine thousand nine hundred (39,900) nor more than forty thousand (40,000), according to the 2000 federal census or any subsequent federal census, shall be governed by a five-member board of utility district commissioners.  No person shall be eligible for appointment as utility district commissioner unless the person is a customer of the utility district and resides within the service area of the utility district.  As used in this subdivision (g)(1), “customer” means a person who is regularly billed for utility service rendered by the district and who pays money for such service.
  
  
    (2) The regular term of office of each utility district commissioner shall be four (4) years.  In order to establish staggered terms on the board, the three (3) incumbent commissioners serving on May 24, 2004, shall each serve an initial term of four (4) years, commencing on May 24, 2004.  Thereafter, those three (3) offices shall be subject to appointment every four (4) years in accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth in this subsection (g).  The initial term of office of each of the two (2) commissioners added by this subsection (g) shall be two (2) years, commencing on May 24, 2004, to be filled in accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth in this subsection (g).  Thereafter, those two (2) offices shall be subject to appointment every four (4) years in accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth in this subsection (g).  All unscheduled vacancies arising after May 24, 2004, shall be filled, for the remainder of the unexpired term, in accordance with the requirements and procedures set forth in this subsection (g).
  
  
    (3) Within sixty (60) days after the occurrence of any vacancy in the office of any utility district commissioner caused by death, resignation, disability, or forfeiture of office, and no later than sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the term of office of any incumbent utility district commissioner, the board of utility district commissioners or its remaining members shall select three (3) qualified nominees to fill such office for the remainder of the term or for the full term, as the case may be, and, under the seal of the board of commissioners, shall certify such list of nominees in order of preference recommended by such commissioners, to the county mayor.  Within fourteen (14) days after issuance of certification by the board of commissioners to the county mayor, the county mayor shall enter an order either appointing one of the nominees or rejecting the entire list.  If this or any subsequent list of nominees is not timely submitted to the county mayor, then the county mayor shall proceed to appoint a qualified person to serve on the board of utility commissioners.  Any order either making an appointment or rejecting the entire list of nominees shall be entered of record on the minutes of the county legislative body, and a certified copy of the order shall be furnished to the board of utility district commissioners.  However, if the entire list of nominees is rejected by the county mayor, then the board of commissioners shall select a second list consisting of three (3) other qualified nominees to fill such office and, under the seal of the board of commissioners, shall certify such second list of other nominees in order of preference recommended by such commissioners, to the county mayor within fourteen (14) days following entry of the order rejecting the first list of nominees.  Within fourteen (14) days after the second issuance of certification by the board of utility district commissioners to the county mayor, the county mayor shall enter an order either appointing one of the nominees or rejecting the entire second list.  Any order either making an appointment or rejecting the entire list of nominees shall be entered of record on the minutes of the county legislative body, and a certified copy of the order shall be furnished to the board of utility district commissioners.  However, if the entire second list of nominees is rejected by the county mayor, then, within fourteen (14) days following entry of such order, the county mayor shall request the board of commissioners or its remaining members to submit the third and final list consisting of three (3) other qualified nominees to fill such office or, alternatively, the county mayor shall request the county legislative body to submit the third and final list consisting of three (3) other, qualified nominees to fill such office;  provided, further, however, that prior to requesting a list of nominees from the county legislative body, the county mayor must file a written statement with the county legislative body setting forth the mayor's specific reasons for rejecting each of the six (6) nominees previously selected by the utility district board of commissioners or its remaining members.  Such written statement shall constitute a public record and shall be available for public inspection.  Within fourteen (14) days following such request, the board of utility district commissioners or the county legislative body shall select the final list consisting of three (3) other qualified nominees to fill such office and shall certify such list of additional nominees in order of preference recommended to the county mayor.  Within fourteen (14) days following such certification, the county mayor shall enter an order either appointing one of the nominees or rejecting the entire final list.  Any order either making an appointment or rejecting the entire list of nominees shall be entered of record on the minutes of the county legislative body, and a certified copy of the order shall be furnished to the board of utility district commissioners.  If the county mayor rejects the entire final list, then the vacant, or to be vacated, office of utility district commissioner shall be filled by appointment by the county mayor without any further nominations.
  
  
    (4) In implementing this subsection (g), the nominating and appointing authorities shall give due consideration to the need for racial, gender, age and ethnic minority diversity on the utility district board of commissioners.
  
  
    (5) No later than January 31 of each calendar year, any water utility district subject to this subsection (g) shall notify the county mayor of the county that created the utility district, in writing, of the beginning and ending dates of the terms of office of each member of the utility district's board of commissioners in office on January 1 of each calendar year.
  

  
    (h)(1) Notwithstanding this section or any other law to the contrary, the membership of the board of commissioners for any multi-county water utility district, whose principal office is located in, and whose present service area primarily lies within, the boundaries of any county having a population of not less than seventeen thousand four hundred (17,400) nor more than seventeen thousand four hundred fifty (17,450), according to the 2000 federal census or any subsequent federal census, and containing and physically divided by a United States government corps of engineers dam and reservoir project of thirty-four thousand (34,000) acres, shall be as provided in this subsection (h).  On June 3, 2004, board membership from the county containing the principal office and the primary service area of such utility district shall be increased by two (2) members giving such county three (3) members on the board.  The other two (2) counties within the service area having not less than one hundred fifty (150) customers shall be represented by one (1) board member from each such county and the two (2) present board members shall continue to serve on the board for the remainder of their terms and be appointed from such counties as otherwise provided by law.
  
  
    (2) The two (2) new members of the board of commissioners added pursuant to subdivision (h)(1) shall be filled by appointment of the county mayor of the county containing the principal office and the primary service area of such utility district.  As soon as possible after June 3, 2004, the existing board of commissioners shall select three (3) nominees for each of such two (2) new members, in full accordance with any residential requirements that may apply to the office created, and under the seal of the board of commissioners, shall certify such lists of nominees to such county mayor.  Within twenty-one (21) days after the issuance of certification by the board of commissioners to the county mayor, the county mayor may enter an order either appointing one of the nominees from each such list or rejecting one of the lists or both lists.  Any order either appointing or rejecting a list of nominees shall be entered of record on the minutes of the county legislative body and a certified copy of the order shall be furnished to the board of commissioners and to the appointee;  provided, however, that upon the rejection of any entire list of nominees by the county mayor, the board of commissioners shall continue to submit new nonidentical lists of three (3) nominees to the county mayor within sixty (60) days after each such rejection until such procedure shall result in the position being filled for the new term, as provided in this subdivision (h)(2).  If the county mayor fails to make an appointment for a position from such list or lists following three (3) submissions for such position, then the county mayor shall appoint the director or directors for such position or positions, as the case may be, without any further nominations.
  
  
    (3) Notwithstanding this section or any other law to the contrary, within two (2) weeks after the occurrence of a vacancy in the office of any commissioner and no later than thirty (30) days prior to the scheduled expiration of the term of office of any incumbent commissioner, the board of commissioners or its remaining members shall select three (3) nominees to fill such office, in full accordance with residential requirements applicable to the office vacated or to be vacated, and, under the seal of the board of commissioners, shall certify such list of nominees to the county mayor of the county whose representation on the board shall be directly affected by the vacancy. Copies shall also be sent to the county mayors of the other two (2) counties.  If all three (3) nominees are rejected by the mayor of the affected county, then the nominating pr"

    (3) To implement subdivision (a)(1), the general assembly by private act, or the local legislative body by resolution, may adopt a plan to accomplish a transition from a method of selecting school board members authorized under prior law to an elected school board that is in compliance with subdivision (a)(1).  Nothing in this section shall be construed to require simultaneous election of board members, nor to prevent board members selected under prior law or during a transition period from serving the full term for which they were selected.  As part of the implementation process under subdivision (a)(1), the local legislative body may renumber existing school districts.  During the transition period, the number of school board members may exceed the number authorized under subdivision (a)(1).  A transition plan may not be validly enacted or adopted under this section after September 1, 1996.

      (B) If the person ceases to attend the substance abuse treatment program, the service provider shall notify the court of the person's absence within three (3) business days of the date the provider knew or should have known of such absence.  If the person fails to successfully complete the program for any other reason, the provider shall notify the court of such failure.
    
  
  
    (4) A person who does not successfully complete the substance abuse treatment program to which the person is ordered is in violation of the person's probation, and the court shall order the person committed to the county jail or workhouse for service of the full period of the mandatory minimum confinement required by law and any portion of confinement in excess of the minimum imposed by the court that the court deems necessary.  The person shall receive no sentence reduction credits for any time spent in the substance abuse treatment program prior to failure to complete the program.
  
  
    (5) Upon successful completion of a substance abuse treatment program, the person shall be required to report to the county jail or workhouse to serve the remainder of any mandatory period of confinement required by law and imposed by the court.  Failure to do so is a violation of the person's probation.
  
  
    (6) If a person voluntarily attends residential treatment after arrest but before sentencing, the person may receive sentence reduction credits for completion of residential treatment if the person is ordered to treatment by the judge as a condition of probation.  However, before commencing any court-ordered treatment program, the person must undergo a clinical substance abuse assessment as provided in subdivision (h)(1), serve the mandatory minimum sentence provided in subdivision (a)(2)(B) or (a)(3)(B), and follow the recommendations of the assessment.

    (i)(1) Ordering a person to treatment as a condition of probation pursuant to subdivision (a)(2), (a)(3), and subsection (h) for a second or third violation of 
§ 55-10-401
       is solely within the discretion of the judge as an available sentencing option.  Failure to grant such person such treatment is not appealable, except for abuse of discretion.
  
  
    (2) Nothing in this section shall be construed as creating a right for a person convicted of a second or third violation of 
§ 55-10-401
       to receive:
    
      (A) A clinical substance abuse assessment;
    
    
      (B) Intensive outpatient treatment;
    
    
      (C) Residential treatment;
    
    
      (D) Enrollment in a state certified treatment program, including drug court or DUI court;  or
    
    
      (E) Any sentence reduction credits for substance abuse treatment that would reduce the period of incarceration imposed by the court other than those earned and retained pursuant to subdivision (h)(2)(A) and (B).
    
  
  
    
      (3)(A) Nothing in this section authorizing a judge to order any of the options specified in subdivision (i)(2) shall be construed to affect or limit any restrictions a judge may place or is required to place on a person convicted of a second or third violation of 
  § 55-10-401
 by other provisions of law, including the use of an ignition interlock device under 
  § 55-10-409
.
    
    
      (B) This section governs those instances in which a person is convicted of a second or third violation of 
  § 55-10-401
 and the judge chooses to order the person to participate in a substance abuse treatment program as a condition of probation pursuant to this section.  In those instances in which the person is a second or third offender but the judge declines to order treatment pursuant to this section, or in which the person is convicted of a first or fourth or subsequent violation of 
  § 55-10-401
, 
  § 55-10-410
 applies.
    
  

  
    (j)(1) The court is not empowered to order the expenditure of public funds to provide treatment.  However, if a person ordered to participate in such a program is indigent, the court may allow the person, subject to availability of services, to enter any program that provides the treatment without cost to an individual.  When making a finding as to the indigency of an accused, the court shall take into consideration:
    
      (A) The nature of the program services rendered;
    
    
      (B) The usual and customary charges for rendering such program services in the community;

      (E) The ownership or equity of any real or personal property of the person;  and
    
    
      (F) Any other circumstances presented to the court that are relevant to the issue of indigency.
    
  
  
    (2) If a person ordered to participate is not indigent and participates in a program that provides treatment without cost to an individual, that person shall be obligated to pay for treatment in the same manner as provided in 
§ 33-2-1102
      .  If a person ordered to participate, participates in a court approved private treatment program, that person shall be responsible for the cost and fees involved with the program.
  

  (k) If a person commits a second or third violation of 
      § 55-10-401
     prior to July 1, 2014, but the conviction for such offense does not occur until after July 1, 2014, the person shall elect to the judge at the time of conviction whether to come within the provisions of 
      2014 Pub.Acts, c. 904
    , or be sentenced in accordance with the law in effect at the time the offense was committed."

Public Planning and Housing § 13-20-205,"(a) Any authority may, and is authorized to, adopt a redevelopment plan or urban renewal plan so that it contains a tax increment financing provision providing that taxes, if any, levied upon property within the boundaries of the redevelopment plan or urban renewal plan each year, by any taxing agency after the effective date of the resolution of the governing body approving the redevelopment plan or urban renewal plan or amendment, shall be divided as follows:
  
    (1) For properties subject to a redevelopment plan or urban renewal plan containing or amended to contain a tax increment financing provision approved prior to July 1, 2006, that portion of the taxes which would be produced by the rate at which the tax is levied each year by each taxing agency, upon the assessed value of such property as shown upon the assessment roll of the appropriate assessor, as of the date of the most recently determined valuation prior to the acquisition of such property by the authority (the assessed value being herein called the “base assessment”) shall be allocated to, and when collected, shall be paid to, the respective taxing agencies as taxes levied by such taxing agencies on all other property are paid;  provided, that in any year in which the actual assessment of the area comprising a redevelopment project is less than the base assessment, there shall be allocated and paid to the respective taxing agencies only those taxes actually produced by the application of the current tax rates against such actual assessment.  For properties subject to a redevelopment plan or urban renewal plan containing or amended to contain a tax increment financing provision approved after July 1, 2006, the base assessment of the property for purposes of this subdivision (a)(1) shall be determined as of the date of the most recently determined valuation prior to the date on which the redevelopment plan or urban renewal plan or amendment of the plan was approved by the applicable municipality or municipalities pursuant to 
§ 13-20-203

    (3) Upon the retirement of all bonds, loans or other indebtedness incurred by the authority and payable from such special fund or funds or at such time as moneys on deposit in such special fund or funds are sufficient for such purpose, all the taxes referred to in subdivision (a)(2) shall, when collected, be paid to the respective taxing agencies as taxes levied by such taxing agencies on all other property are paid;  and
  
  
    (4) Taxes shall be levied and collected over all or any part of the area comprising a redevelopment project in the manner provided by law with the following exceptions:
    
      (A) The appropriate assessor shall, in each year during the period in which taxes are to be allocated to the authority pursuant to subdivision (a)(2), compute and certify the net amount, if any, by which the then current assessed value of all taxable property located within the redevelopment project which is subject to taxation by the particular taxing agency exceeds the base assessment.  The net amount of any such increase is referred to in this subdivision (a)(4) as the incremental value for that particular year;
    
    
      (B) In any year in which taxes are to be allocated to the authority pursuant to subdivision (a)(2) in which there is an incremental value, the appropriate assessor shall exclude it from the assessed value upon which the appropriate assessor computes the tax rates for taxes levied that year by the taxing agency.  However, the appropriate assessor shall extend the aggregate tax rate of such taxes against the base assessment and the incremental value and shall apply the taxes collected therefrom, subject to any other provisions hereof, as provided above;  and
    
    
      (C) For purposes of this section, if in any year property comprising a portion of a particular redevelopment project shall be removed from the tax rolls of a taxing agency, the base assessment for the area of such redevelopment project shall be reduced by the amount of the base assessment allocable to the property so removed for each subsequent year in which taxes are to be allocated to a particular authority pursuant to the above provisions.
    
  

  
    (b)(1) If an authority adopts a redevelopment plan or an amendment to an existing plan which includes tax increment financing provisions, such new plan or the existing plan, as so amended, shall describe, in addition to the matters required by

  (d) The foregoing provisions of subsections (b) and (c) shall not apply to any redevelopment plan or amendment to an existing plan which included a tax increment financing provision and which has been submitted to and approved by the governing body of the municipality, or agency designated by it or empowered by law so to act, in which any of the area to be covered by the redevelopment project is situated pursuant to and in accordance with

     prior to April 11, 1978, and the previously approved redevelopment plan or amendment thereto described above shall not be required to be resubmitted and approved by the governing body or agency pursuant to the additional provision of subsections (b) and (c).  The remaining provisions of this section shall be applicable to and govern the previously approved plan and the tax increment financing provision contained in such plan.

  (e) After the approval by the governing body of a redevelopment plan containing a tax increment financing provision or an amendment to an existing plan adding a tax increment financing provision, the authority shall transmit to the appropriate assessors of property and to each taxing agency to be affected a copy of the description of all land within the redevelopment area and the date or dates of the approval of the redevelopment plan or amendment to the plan, a copy of the resolution approving the redevelopment plan or approving an amendment to the plan, and a map or plat indicating the boundaries of the property;  and taxes shall thereafter, when collected, be allocated and paid in the manner provided in the redevelopment plan or amendment to the plan.

  (f) Any property which the authority leases to private individuals or corporations for development under a redevelopment plan and any property which the authority has developed under a redevelopment plan and leases to private individuals or corporations shall have the same tax status as if such leased property were owned by such private individuals or corporations.  After June 1, 1997, the foregoing provisions of this subsection (f) shall apply only to property financed with tax increment financing.  Prior to June 1, 1997, any property owned, constructed, or improved by the authority which is not financed through tax increment financing shall have the same tax status as all other property owned by the authority.

  (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, taxes levied upon property subject to tax increment financing provisions by any taxing agency for the payment of principal of and interest on all bonds, loans or other indebtedness of such taxing agency, and taxes levied by or for the benefit of the state of Tennessee, shall not be subject to allocation as provided in subsection (a), but shall be levied against such property and, when collected, paid to such taxing agency as taxes levied by such taxing agency on all other property are paid and collected.

  (h) In the event of any conflict between this section or this chapter and the Uniformity in Tax Increment Financing Act of 2012, compiled in title 9, chapter 23, title 9, chapter 23 shall control."

  (d) The commissioner is authorized to rent suitable quarters at some point in each congressional district, if the same cannot be procured otherwise in public buildings, as an office for such assistant commissioner or service officer and may employ in connection therewith as well as in connection with the principal office, such clerical assistance as may be found necessary, all with the approval of the governor, the salaries to be paid to be commensurate with those paid for like services in other departments of the state.

Nothing in this subdivision (f)(1) shall apply to placement of material from coal preparation and processing plants;
  
  
    (2) Without limiting the applicability of this section, if the commissioner determines that surface coal mining at a particular site will violate water quality standards because acid mine drainage from the site will not be amenable to treatment with proven technology both during the permit period or subsequent to completion of mining activities, the permit shall be denied. 
  

  (g) The commissioner may grant permits authorizing the discharges or activities described in subsection (b), including, but not limited to, land application of wastewater, but in granting such permits shall impose such conditions, including effluent standards and conditions and terms of periodic review, as are necessary to accomplish the purposes of this part, and as are not inconsistent with the regulations promulgated by the board.  Under no circumstances shall the commissioner issue a permit for an activity that would cause a condition of pollution either by itself or in combination with others.  In addition the permits shall include:

      § 8-21-901
     and elsewhere.  These fees also do not include state and local litigation taxes.

  (b) The rendering of services under a mutual aid agreement, an automatic response agreement, an operational agreement, or any other agreement as allowed under a comprehensive growth plan, pursuant to chapter 58 of this title, or the providing of mutual aid or assistance under the Mutual Aid and Emergency and Disaster Assistance Agreement Act of 2004, compiled in title 58, chapter 8, is not admissible as evidence against the municipality in any action brought under this section or title 29, chapter 14.

  (c) The municipality shall have the burden of proving that an annexation ordinance is reasonable for the overall well-being of the communities involved.

  
    (d)(1) If more than one (1) suit is filed, all of them shall be consolidated and tried as one (1) in the first court of appropriate jurisdiction in which suit is filed.  Suit or suits shall be tried on an issue to be made up there, and the question shall be whether the proposed annexation is or is not unreasonable in consideration of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens and property owners of the territory sought to be annexed and the citizens and property owners of the municipality.  Should the court find the ordinance to be unreasonable, or to have been done by exercise of powers not conferred by law, an order shall be issued vacating the ordinance and the municipality shall be prohibited from annexing, pursuant to the authority of 
§ 6-51-102
      , any part of the territory proposed for annexation by such vacated ordinance for a period of at least twenty-four (24) months following the date of such order.  In the absence of such finding, an order shall be issued sustaining the validity of such ordinance, which shall then become operative thirty-one (31) days after judgment is entered unless an abrogating appeal has been taken from the judgment, or unless the presiding court grants the municipality's petition to defer the effective date pursuant to subdivision (d)(2).
  
  
    (2) Upon petition of the municipality, the presiding court may, as part of the judgment sustaining the validity of the annexation ordinance, order that the effective date of the ordinance be fixed as December 31 following the date of entry of the judgment or determination of appeal.  In making any order under this subdivision (d)(2), the court shall consider the necessity of the deferred effective date to render municipal services to the annexed territory within a reasonable time.  The petition shall be filed by the municipality in the presiding court where the annexation ordinance is being contested in a quo warranto proceeding as provided in this section.
  

  (e) If on appeal judgment shall be against the validity of such ordinance, an order shall be entered vacating the same and the municipality shall be prohibited from annexing, pursuant to the authority of 
      § 6-51-102
    , any part of the territory proposed for annexation by such vacated ordinance for a period of at least twenty-four (24) months following the date of such order.  If judgment shall be in favor of the validity of such ordinance, it shall become operative forthwith by court order and shall not be subject to contest or attack in legal or equitable proceeding for any cause or reason, the judgment of the appellate court being final.

  (f) Should the territory hereafter sought to be annexed be the site of substantial industrial plant development, a fact to be ascertained by the court, the municipality shall have the burden of proving that the annexation of the site of the industrial plant development is not unreasonable in consideration of the factors above mentioned, including the necessity for or use of municipal services by the industrial plant or plants, and the present ability and intent of the municipality to benefit the industrial plant development by rendering municipal services thereto when and as needed.  The policy and purpose of this provision is to prevent annexation of industrial plants for the sole purpose of increasing municipal revenue, without the ability and intent to benefit the area annexed by rendering municipal services, when and as needed, and when such services are not used or required by the industrial plants.

  (g) During the time that any annexation ordinance is being contested as provided in this section, the annexing municipality and the county governing body or any affected school, sanitary or utility district, or all such districts, may enter into an agreement to provide for new, expanded, and/or upgraded services and facilities, including, but not limited to, equipment, land and buildings, and capital expenditures, including sale of bonds, to finance such services and facilities, which agreement shall include an equitable division of the cost and liabilities of such capital expenditures between the annexing municipality and the county governing body or any affected school, sanitary, or utility district, or all such districts, upon final determination of such contested annexation ordinance.

  (h) When territory is annexed that is located in a county other than one in which the city hall of the annexing municipality is then located, any suit filed pursuant to this section for the purpose of contesting the annexation ordinance shall be filed in the county where the city hall of the annexing municipality is located.  The chancellor, however, shall change the venue to a county that is adjacent to either the county where the annexing municipality's city hall is located or the county where the proposed annexation is located.

  (i) When a final judgment is rendered in a quo warranto suit contesting a proposed annexation, the municipality shall notify the county mayor of the outcome of the litigation, so the county may keep abreast of the status of a pending annexation.  Similarly, when a municipality files an appeal of a decision in a quo warranto suit, the municipality shall notify the county mayor of the pending appeal."

    (7) Carefully preserve as permanent records the recorded copies of all deeds, deeds of trust and other instruments affecting interests in real estate;

    (2) The office of register of deeds in such county is further authorized to implement a method to accept the optional payment of fees for recording deeds and other instruments by means of electronic funds transfer.  The method implemented shall ensure that such transfer is properly documented and recorded.

§ 67-6-712

§ 67-6-393
       and any other data or information the commissioner deems relevant, shall substantially reimburse counties and municipalities for the loss of local tax under this part resulting from the exemption provided by 
§ 67-6-393
      .  The amount of the reimbursement shall be approximately equal to the aggregate amount of local tax that would have been collected under this part on the sale or use of goods otherwise taxable but for 
§ 67-6-393
      .
  
  
    (2) If the loss of local tax subject to reimbursement under this subsection (h) cannot be identified to a particular situs, the amount of the reimbursement shall be distributed to the counties based on the ratio of total local tax collections in the county under this part over the total local tax collections in all counties under this part.  The amount received by the county under this subdivision (h)(2) shall be distributed first as provided for in 
§ 67-6-712(a)(1)
      .  The remainder shall be distributed to each municipality in the county based on the ratio of total collections in that municipality over the total collections in the county and shall be distributed to the county based on the ratio of total collections in the unincorporated portions of the county over the total collections in the county.

§ 55-50-504
      , unless in any case an order of a court provides for a longer period of suspension.  At the end of the period for which a license has been suspended, the department is authorized, in its discretion, to require a reexamination of the licensee as a prerequisite to the reissuance of the license.
  
  
    (2) Any person whose license is suspended for driving under the influence of drugs or intoxicants, or for refusal to submit to a blood test under

      .
  

  (g) When considering the suspension of a driver license, the department may take into account offenses committed by that driver outside this state and reported to the department only if the offenses would, under the laws of this state, be considered grounds for suspension in this state.  If the offenses would be grounds for suspension in the state of conviction, but not in this state they shall be disregarded by the department.

§ 40-24-101
      .  Failure to timely make the payments as ordered by the court shall result in the suspension of the restricted license.  Any person whose driver license or permit is revoked, suspended or cancelled for any reason other than subdivision (a)(1)(H) shall not be eligible for, nor shall the court have any authority to order the issuance of the restricted license pursuant to this subsection (j).  The restricted license shall be valid only for the purpose of going to and from work at the person's regular place of employment.  The judge shall have the authority to issue a restricted driver license under this subsection (j) only one (1) time per violator.
  
  
    (2) The judge shall order the issuance of a restricted license, based upon the records of the department of safety, if:

    (6) In emergency communication districts established in any county having a population in excess of eight hundred thousand (800,000), according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal census, one (1) of the members of the board of the directors of the district shall be an actively engaged firefighter, police officer or emergency medical technician;  provided, that, if, on April 5, 1995, one (1) such person is not a member of the board in such county, when a vacancy occurs on the board or at the expiration of the term of office of a member of the board, at least one (1) person meeting the qualifications established in this subdivision (b)(6) shall be appointed to the board.

      (8)(A) Notwithstanding this section to the contrary, in any emergency communications district created by a municipality after July 1, 2002, the board of directors of the district may be the legislative body of such municipality.  If the board of the directors of the district is comprised of the legislative body, then the terms of the members of the board of directors shall run concurrently with their terms as members of the legislative body.  The terms of the members of the legislative body shall run concurrently with their terms as members on the board of directors.

    (4) The failure of the department to issue a state-issued certificate of franchise authority within forty-five (45) days of receipt of a completed application from any of the entities set forth in subdivision (d)(3) shall constitute issuance of the requested state-issued certificate of franchise authority without further action required by the applicant.  The failure of the department to issue a state-issued certificate of franchise authority within one hundred eighty (180) days of receipt of a completed application from any other applicant shall constitute temporary issuance of the requested state-issued certificate of franchise authority to the applicant subject to final approval or rejection of the application by the department.
  

  (e) The state-issued certificate of franchise authority issued by the department shall contain the following and no other items:
  
    (1) A nonexclusive grant of authority to provide cable or video service in the areas set forth in the application;

    (3) A statement that the grant of authority is subject to lawful operation of the cable or video service by the applicant or its successor in interest;  and

§ 65-21-204
       for internal improvements or as provided in title 29, chapter 16.
  

  
    (f)(1) The state-issued certificate of franchise authority issued by the department shall be for a term of ten (10) years.  Upon the expiration of the initial term, the holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority may reapply pursuant to the process set forth in this section.
  
  
    
      (2)(A) The holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority shall, as a condition of maintaining the franchise authority, pay an annual fee as provided in this subdivision (f)(2) to cover the direct costs of the department in administering 
  §§ 7-59-308
 and

 regarding the resolution of any complaints filed with the department.  The holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority may designate that portion of the subscriber's bill attributable to the fee established by this subsection (f) and recover such amount from the subscriber as a separate item on the bill.
    
    
      (B) For the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2009, the annual fee shall be collected in the aggregate from all holders of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority and shall not exceed one hundred seven thousand dollars ($107,000).  In order to fairly assess the fee, the department shall calculate the total number of subscribers obtaining service from holders of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority based on quarterly franchise fee statements as of the end of the second quarter each year provided pursuant to 
  § 7-59-306
.  Based on such calculation, the department shall assess each holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority a percentage of the amount established in this subdivision (f)(2) for the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2009, to be paid to the department by each holder within thirty (30) days of the date the department notifies the holder of the holder's share of the annual fee.  The annual fees for 2009 shall be assessed on July 31, 2009.  The percentage shall be calculated by dividing the holder's number of cable or video subscribers served under a state-issued certificate of franchise authority by the total number of cable or video subscribers of all holders served under all state-issued certificates of franchise authority.  Notwithstanding such provisions, any payments collected from the state-issued certificate of franchise authority application fees and amendment fees shall be applied to reduce the annual fee required by this subsection (f).  In addition, no holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority shall be assessed any amounts attributable to enforcement actions directed against another holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority other than those arising under 
  § 7-59-308
.
    
    
      
(C)(i) For subsequent fiscal years, by September 15 of each year, the comptroller shall review the amount assessed in the previous fiscal year and make a determination as to whether the annual fee should be increased or decreased based on the following factors:

  (a) The actual administrative costs incurred by the department in connection with the reasonable performance of its duties established in 
      §§ 7-59-308
     and 
      7-59-312
    ;


  (b) The actual number of cable or video-related complaints handled by the department;


  (c) The complexity of cable or video-related complaints handled by the department;


  (d) The amount of application and amendment fees collected by the department;


  (e) The amount of personnel time necessary to accomplish the functions of the department relating to holders of state-issued certificates of franchise authority;  and


  (f) Any other factors deemed essential by the comptroller to certify a fair annual assessment amount.

      
      
(ii) The comptroller shall certify the annual fee for each fiscal year and notify the department of the maximum annual fee that may be assessed to all holders of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority based on the calculation established in subdivision (f)(2)(B), which fee, if an increase as certified by the comptroller, shall in no event increase by more than five percent (5%) from the previous year's annual fee.
      
    
  

  (g) Any successor in interest to the holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority shall apply for a state-issued certificate of franchise authority as provided for in this section and consistent with 
      § 7-59-304(a)(5)
    .

  (h) The state-issued certificate of franchise authority issued pursuant to this part may be terminated by the cable or video service provider by submitting written notice of the termination to the department with a copy to the governing authority of the affected municipality or county.  The department is neither required nor authorized to act upon the notice.  Terminating state-issued certificate of franchise authority holders shall provide all existing customers with ninety (90) days written notice of the termination prior to actual termination and shall refund to the customers any payments or deposits for which service has not been provided.  A holder's decision to terminate its state-issued certificate of franchise authority does not relieve the holder of its obligations with respect to the payment of any franchise fees or other funds owed to a municipality or county or the removal of its facilities within the public right-of-way, consistent with local rights-of-way ordinances or resolutions.

  
    (i)(1) A cable or video service provider shall file an application to amend its state-issued certificate of franchise authority to reflect any change in information required under subsection (c);  provided, however, that the department may not deny the issuance of an amended state-issued certificate of franchise authority unless it has determined, in response to a complaint authorized by this part, that the holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority has:
    
      (A) Acted in bad faith in its failure to comply with its obligations and representations made in its original application or any prior amendment to the application;  or
    
    
      (B) Acted in bad faith in its withdrawal of service from areas within which there is no access to other cable or video service.
    
  
  
    (2) The applicant must file a copy of any amendment with the governing authority of the affected municipality or county.  If the amendment includes new areas within the holder's franchise area, the applicable provisions and requirements of subdivisions (c)(3) and (9) shall be met.  Notice must be provided to other entities with facilities in the rights-of-way, consistent with any nondiscriminatory and generally applicable local ordinance or resolution requiring the notice prior to performing any installation in the right-of-way of the affected municipality or county.
  

  (j) Unless otherwise provided for in this section, the state-issued certificate of franchise authority issued pursuant to this part supersedes and is in lieu of any franchise authority or approval required by state or local law as of July 1, 2008.

  (k) A large telecommunications provider shall apply for an initial state-issued certificate of franchise authority within one (1) year after July 1, 2008.  A large telecommunications provider may apply for a local franchise at any time.

  (l) A holder of a state-issued certificate of franchise authority shall comply with all applicable FCC requirements involving the distribution and notification of emergency messages over the emergency alert system consistent with the enforcement of the rules, and any waivers to the rules, as determined by the FCC.  To the extent that a local government has the capacity, pursuant to an existing unexpired local franchise, to locally override the cable or video system, that capability shall remain active from the incumbent provider until the natural expiration of the franchise so long as the local emergency override capability is not in conflict with applicable state regulations concerning emergency communications.  Notwithstanding an election by a cable provider or video service provider to terminate a local franchise, until the date the franchise would have naturally terminated, an incumbent cable or video service provider shall continue to provide emergency override capabilities that existed as of July 1, 2008, so long as the local emergency override capability is not in conflict with applicable state regulations concerning emergency communications."

Education § 49-12-101,"On February 8, 1948, the state of Tennessee and the states of Florida, Maryland, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma, West Virginia, and the commonwealth of Virginia, through and by their respective governors, entered into a written compact relative to the development and maintenance of regional educational services and schools in the southern states in the professional, technological, scientific, literary, and other fields, so as to provide greater educational advantages and facilities for the citizens of the several states who reside within such region.The compact, as amended is as follows:THE REGIONAL COMPACTWHEREAS, the states who are parties hereto have during the past several years conducted a careful investigation looking toward the establishment and maintenance of jointly owned and operated regional educational institutions in the southern states in the professional, technological, scientific, literary and other fields, so as to provide greater educational advantages and facilities for the citizens of the several states who reside within such region;  andWHEREAS, Meharry Medical College, of Nashville, Tennessee, has proposed that its lands, buildings, equipment, and the net income from its endowment be turned over to the southern states, or to an agency acting in their behalf, to be operated as a regional institution for medical, dental and nursing education upon terms and conditions to be hereafter agreed upon between the southern states and Meharry Medical College, which proposal, because of the present financial condition of the institution, has been approved by the states who are parties hereto;  andWHEREAS, the states desire to enter into a compact with each other providing for the planning and establishment of regional educational facilities;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, covenants and obligations assumed by the respective states who are parties hereto (hereinafter referred to as “states”), the several states do hereby form a geographical district or region consisting of the areas lying within the boundaries of the contracting states which, for the purposes of this compact, shall constitute an area for regional education supported by public funds derived from taxation by the constituent states and derived from other sources for the establishment, acquisition, operation and maintenance of regional educational schools and institutions for the benefit of citizens of the respective states residing within the region so established as may be determined from time to time in accordance with the terms and provisions of this compact.The states do further hereby establish and create a joint agency which shall be known as the board of control for southern regional education (hereinafter referred to as the “board”), the members of which board shall consist of the governor of each state ex officio and four (4) additional citizens of each state to be appointed by the governor thereof, at least one (1) of whom shall be selected from the field of education, and at least one (1) of whom shall be a member of the legislature of the state.  The governor shall continue as a member of the board during his tenure of office as governor of the state, but the members of the board appointed by the governor shall hold office for a period of four (4) years, except that in the original appointments one (1) board member so appointed by the governor shall be designated at the time of his appointment to serve an initial term of two (2) years, one (1) board member to serve an initial term of three (3) years, and the remaining board member to serve the full term of four (4) years, but thereafter the successor of each appointed board member shall serve the full term of four (4) years.  Vacancies on the board caused by death, resignation, refusal or inability to serve shall be filled by appointment by the governor for the unexpired portion of the term.  If the member of the board who represents the legislature discontinues service in the legislature for any reason, he shall be dropped from membership on the board, and a vacancy will occur.  The officers of the board shall be a chair, a vice chair, a secretary, a treasurer, and such additional officers as may be created by the board from time to time.  The board shall meet annually and officers shall be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting.  The board shall have the right to formulate and establish bylaws consistent with the provisions of this compact to govern its own actions in the performance of the duties delegated to it, including the right to create and appoint an executive committee and a finance committee with such powers and authority as the board may delegate to them from time to time.  The board may, within its discretion, elect as its chair a person who is not a member of the board, provided such person resides within a signatory state, and upon such election such person shall become a member of the board with all the rights and privileges of such membership.It is the duty of the board to submit plans and recommendations to the states from time to time for their approval and adoption by appropriate legislative action for the development, establishment, acquisition, operation and maintenance of educational schools and institutions within the geographical limits of the regional area of the states, of such character and type and for such educational purposes, professional, technological, scientific, literary or otherwise, as they may deem and determine to be proper, necessary or advisable.  Title to all such educational institutions when so established by appropriate legislative actions of the states and to all properties and facilities used in connection therewith shall be vested in the board as the agency of and for the use and benefit of the states and the citizens thereof, and all such educational institutions shall be operated, maintained and financed in the manner herein set out, subject to any provisions or limitations which may be contained in the legislative acts of the states authorizing the creation, establishment and operation of such educational institutions.In addition to the power and authority heretofore granted, the board shall have the power to enter into such agreements or arrangements with any of the states and with educational institutions or agencies, as may be required in the judgment of the board, to provide adequate services and facilities for graduate, professional, and technical education for the benefit of the citizens of the respective states residing within the region, and such additional and general power and authority as may be invested in the board from time to time by legislative enactment of the states.Any two (2) or more states who are parties of this compact shall have the right to enter into supplemental agreements providing for the establishment, financing and operation of regional educational institutions for the benefit of citizens residing within an area which constitutes a portion of the general region herein created, such institutions to be financed exclusively by such states and to be controlled exclusively by the members of the board representing such states, provided such agreement is submitted to and approved by the board prior to the establishment of such institutions.Each state agrees that, when authorized by the legislature, it will from time to time make available and pay over to the boards such funds as may be required for the establishment, acquisition, operation and maintenance of such regional educational institutions as may be authorized by the states under the terms of this compact, the contribution of each state at all times to be in the proportion that its population bears to the total combined population of the states who are parties hereto as shown from time to time by the most recent official published report of the bureau of census of the United States, or upon such other basis as may be agreed upon.This compact shall not take effect or be binding upon any state unless and until it shall be approved by proper legislative action of as many as six (6) or more of the states whose governors have subscribed hereto within a period of eighteen (18) months from the date hereof.  When and if six (6) or more states shall have given legislative approval to this compact within the eighteen-month period, it shall be and become binding upon such six (6) or more states sixty (60) days after the date of legislative approval by the sixth state and the governors of such six (6) or more states shall forthwith name the members of the board from their states as hereinabove set out, and the board shall then meet on call of the governor of any state approving this compact, at which time the board shall elect officers, adopt bylaws, appoint committees and otherwise fully organize.  Other states whose names are subscribed hereto shall thereafter become parties hereto upon approval of this compact by legislative action within two (2) years from the date hereof, upon such conditions as may be agreed upon at the time.  With respect to any state whose constitution may require amendment in order to permit legislative approval of the compact, such state or states shall become parties hereto upon approval of this compact by legislative action within seven (7) years from the date hereof, upon such conditions as may be agreed upon at the time.After becoming effective, this compact shall thereafter continue without limitation of time;  provided, that it may be terminated at any time by unanimous action of the states;  and provided further, that any state may withdraw from this compact if such withdrawal is approved by its legislature, such withdrawal to become effective two (2) years after written notice thereof to the board accompanied by a certified copy of the requisite legislative action, but such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations hereunder accruing up to the effective date of such withdrawal.  Any state so withdrawing shall ipso facto cease to have any claim to or ownership of any of the property held or vested in the board or to any of the funds of the board held under the terms of this compact.If any state shall at any time become in default in the performance of any of its obligations assumed herein or with the respect to any obligation imposed upon the state as authorized by and in compliance with the terms and provisions of this compact, all rights, privileges and benefits of such defaulting state, its members on the board and its citizens shall ipso facto be and become suspended from and after the date of such default.  Unless such default shall be remedied and made good within a period of one (1) year immediately following the date of such default, this compact may be terminated with respect to such defaulting state by an affirmative vote of three fourths ( 3/4 ) of the members of the board (exclusive of the members representing the state in default), from and after which time such state shall cease to be a party to this compact and shall have no further claim to or ownership of any of the property held by or vested in the board or to any of the funds of the board held under the terms of this compact, but such termination shall in no manner release such defaulting state from any accrued obligation or otherwise affect this compact or the rights, duties, privileges or obligations of the remaining states thereunder.IN WITNESS WHEREOF this compact has been approved and signed by the governors of the several states, subject to the approval of their respective legislatures in the manner hereinabove set out, as of the 8th day of February, 1948."

  (c) The population of counties, for purposes of this section, shall be determined by the 2000 federal census or the most recent succeeding federal census or a special census as provided in this subsection (c).  A county may not move from one population to another except for a succeeding federal census or a special census.  For the purpose of moving from one population classification to another, each county may take not more than three (3) special censuses at its own expense at any time during the interim between the regular decennial federal censuses.  The special census shall be taken by the federal census bureau or in a manner directed by and satisfactory to the commissioner of economic and community development.  The population of the county shall thereafter be revised in accordance with the special census, effective July 1 following certification of the census results by the federal census bureau or the commissioner of economic and community development to the secretary of state and the comptroller of the treasury.

  (d) On July 1, 2002, and each July thereafter, the minimum compensation for county officials, as provided by this section, shall be increased by a dollar amount equal to the average annualized general increase in state employees' compensation, including the equivalent percentage increase in average state employees' salaries represented by appropriated funds made available to address classification compensation issues, during the prior fiscal year multiplied by the compensation established herein for the county officials of the county with the median population of all counties;  provided, however, that the annualized general increase tied to the increase in state employees' compensation shall not exceed five percent (5%) in any given year;  provided further, notwithstanding the dollar amount provided in this section, that the percentage increase provided for county officials by this subsection (d) shall not be less than the percentage increase established for county officials of the county with the median population of all counties.  On or before May 1 of each year, the commissioner of finance and administration shall certify to the comptroller of the treasury the average annualized general increase in state employee's compensation during that fiscal year.  “Average annualized general increase in state employee's compensation” means the average percentage increase in base salaries for state employees, plus the equivalent percentage increase in average state employees' salaries represented by recurring appropriation amounts provided to improve the level of retirement benefits, longevity benefits, and deferred compensation benefits or other similar benefits that are made available to state employees, not including health insurance benefits.

  (e) The county mayor's compensation shall be at least five percent (5%) higher than the salary paid to any other county constitutional office of the respective counties.  The minimum salary set out above shall apply only to a county mayor who devotes full time to the county mayor's office.  The salary of a county mayor who devotes less than full time to the county mayor's office shall be determined by resolution of the county legislative body prior to the election of such official.  For purposes of this subsection (e), “county official” does not include the judge of general sessions court.

  (f) The state share of the cost pursuant to 
      article II, § 24 of the Constitution of Tennessee

      § 9-6-301
    .

  (g) The compensation for the sheriff and chief administrative officer of the county highway department shall be at least ten percent (10%) higher than the salary paid to the general officers of the county.  The county legislative body of each county may increase or decrease the compensation of the chief administrative officer of the county highway department so long as the compensation is maintained at or above the minimum level established herein.

  (h) All general officers of the county shall be paid the same salary with the exception of any education incentive payments made to certified public administrators under 
      § 5-1-310
     and any payments made to the assessor of property under 
      § 67-1-508
    .

  (i) The county legislative body of each county may increase or decrease compensation of county officials so long as the compensation is maintained at, or above, the minimum levels established herein.

  
    (j)(1) Any action by a county legislative body to exceed the minimum level of compensation for county officials established pursuant to this section must be included in a resolution scheduled for consideration on the agenda of the meeting.  All meetings of the county legislative body shall comply with the requirements of the open meetings act contained in chapter 44, part 1 of this title.
  
  
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (h) to the contrary, a county legislative body may provide to a clerk of court who serves more than one (1) court in the county additional compensation in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the clerk's base compensation.  The increase shall be for the purpose of compensating the clerk for the additional duties and time required to serve multiple courts.  For the purposes of this section, a clerk and master shall be considered eligible for this additional compensation, if the clerk serves as clerk of the court that exercises probate jurisdiction.  In order for the increase to be valid, it must be adopted by resolution of the county legislative body.  For the purpose of subsection (g), any additional compensation provided to a general officer under any provision of this section shall be included when determining the salary paid to the general officers of the county."

§ 6-51-114
      , and then determining the percentage that the population of each governmental entity bears to the total amount.

Consolidated Governments and Local Governmental Functions and Entities § 7-53-312,"(a) The corporation is authorized to prepare and submit to the municipality for approval an economic impact plan in the manner described in this section.

  (b) An economic impact plan shall be a written document and shall specifically identify the area to be included in the plan.  The area to be included in the plan must be located in the municipality and must also include an industrial park within the meaning of 
      § 13-16-202
    , or a project that is either owned by the corporation or with respect to which the corporation has loaned or will loan funds or has otherwise provided or will provide financial assistance.  In addition to such industrial park or project, the area that is the subject of the economic impact plan may also include such other properties that the corporation determines will be directly improved or benefited due to the undertaking of the industrial park or project.  The economic impact plan shall:
  
    (1) Identify the boundaries of the area subject to the plan;
  
  
    (2) Identify the industrial park or project located within the area subject to the plan;
  
  
    (3) Discuss the expected benefits to the municipality from the development of the area subject to the plan, including anticipated tax receipts and jobs created;  and
  
  
    (4) Provide that the property taxes imposed on the property, including the personal property, located within the area subject to the plan will be distributable in the manner described in subsection (c) for a period of time specified in the plan.
  

  (c) Upon the approval by the municipality of an economic impact plan with respect to an area, all property taxes levied upon property located within such area by any taxing agency after the effective date of the plan shall be divided as follows:
  
    (1) That portion of the taxes that is equal to the amount of taxes, if any, that were payable with respect to the property for the year prior to the date the economic impact plan was approved, the “base tax amount”, by the municipality shall be allocated to and, when collected, shall be paid to the respective taxing agencies as taxes levied by such taxing agencies on all other property are paid;  provided, that in any year in which the taxes on any property are less than the base tax amount, there shall be allocated and paid to the respective taxing agencies only those taxes actually imposed;  and
  
  
    (2) Any excess of taxes over the base tax amount shall be allocated to and, when collected, shall be paid into a separate fund of the corporation established to hold such payments until applied for the purposes described in subsection (h).
  

  (d) Notwithstanding subsection (a) to the contrary, the corporation may prepare, and the municipality may approve, an economic impact plan that allocates an amount greater than the base tax amount to the taxing agencies.

  (e) An economic impact plan shall not provide for an allocation of taxes to the corporation for a period in excess of thirty (30) years.

  (f) The governing body of a municipality may approve an economic impact plan by resolution, notwithstanding any local charter provision or other provision to the contrary.  If the area subject to an economic impact plan is located within the corporate limits of a city or town, the taxes that would otherwise be payable to the city, town or county that is not the municipality that created the corporation shall not be paid to the corporation unless such city, town or county has also approved the economic impact plan.

  (g) Before the corporation submits an economic impact plan for approval to the municipality that created such corporation or to any other city or county, the corporation shall hold a public hearing relating to the proposed plan after publishing a notice of such public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality at least two (2) weeks prior to the date of such public hearing.  Such notice shall include the time, place and purpose of the public hearing, and notice of how a map of the area subject to the plan can be viewed by the public.

  (h) All taxes allocated to the corporation pursuant to this section shall only be applied by the corporation to pay expenses of the board in furtherance of promoting economic development in the municipality, to pay the cost of projects, or to pay debt service on bonds or other obligations issued by the corporation to pay the cost of the projects.  The corporation is authorized to pledge any or all amounts received by the corporation pursuant to this section to the payment of such bonds or other obligations.

  (i) After the approval by a municipality of an economic impact plan, the clerk or other recording official of such municipality shall transmit to the appropriate assessor of property and to each taxing agency to be affected, a copy of the description of all property within the area subject to the economic impact plan and a copy of the resolution approving that plan.  If the plan is approved by any taxing agency other than the municipality, the clerk or other recording official of that taxing agency shall also provide a copy of the resolution approving the plan to such assessor of property and taxing agencies.  A copy of the plan and any resolutions approving the plan shall be filed with the comptroller of the treasury, and an annual statement of amounts allocated in excess of the base tax amount shall be filed with the state board of equalization.

  (j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, taxes levied upon property within an economic impact area by any taxing agency for the payment of principal of and interest on all bonds, loans, or other indebtedness of such taxing agency, and taxes levied by or for the benefit of the state, shall not be subject to allocation as provided in subsection (c), but may still be levied against such property and, when collected, paid to such taxing agency as taxes levied by such taxing agency on all other property are paid and collected.

  (k) This section shall not apply to any county having a metropolitan form of government and having a population in excess of five hundred thousand (500,000), according to the 2000 federal census or any subsequent federal census.  With respect to a county with a metropolitan form of government and having a population in excess of five hundred thousand (500,000), 
      § 7-53-314

    (8) Suspend or revoke permits issued to persons engaging in the business of construction, alteration, extension or repair of subsurface sewage disposal systems and to persons engaging in the business of removing accumulated waste from such systems, when it is determined that the person has violated this part or applicable rules and regulations;
  
  
    (9) Require the submission of information in addition to that otherwise required by rules or regulations deemed necessary by the commissioner to determine the suitability of individual lots for subsurface sewage disposal systems;  and
  
  
    (10) Enter into an agreement or contract with county health departments whereby the departments would implement this part or its equivalent in their respective area(s) or jurisdiction.  The duty to enter into an agreement or contract shall be mandatory on the commissioner in counties of the first class and the second class which are administering a subsurface sewage disposal program on April 15, 1986, and in other counties the duty to enter into an agreement or contract shall be mandatory for the commissioner when a request is made to the commissioner by the county mayor of such county;  provided, that the following conditions shall apply:
    
      (A) State reporting requirements must be met by the county health departments;
    
    
      (B) The county health department program standards must be at least as stringent as those of the state law and regulations;
    
    
      (C) The commissioner shall retain the right to exercise oversight and evaluation of performance of the county health departments and to terminate the agreement or contract for cause immediately or otherwise, upon reasonable notice;
    
    
      (D) The commissioner may set such other fiscal, administrative or program requirements as the commissioner deems necessary to maintain consistency and integrity of the statewide program;  and
    
    
      (E) Staffing and resources must be adequate to implement and enforce the program in the local jurisdictions.
    
  

  (b) The commissioner may stipulate those parts of the rules, regulations and standards which may be waived for subdivisions containing fewer than five (5) lots.

  (c) An applicant for a subsurface sewage disposal permit for a parcel of property may submit to the department the results of a high intensity soils evaluation by a soil scientist certified by the department or the results of percolation tests performed on the property.  A permit must be issued to such an applicant for all lots within the parcel which comply with the regulations authorized under subdivision (a)(2) and meet the following requirements:
  
    (1) The results of the percolation test or high intensity soils evaluation must clearly establish that the lot has a percolation rate of:
    
      (A) Not more than one hundred five (105) minutes per inch.  The percolation holes used to determine this rate must be located at the intersection of lines in a grid pattern with maximum perpendicular distances of fifty feet (50′) between the lines of the grid.  Each hole shall be considered reasonably representative of a square area of two thousand five hundred square feet (2,500 sq. ft.) which includes that hole in the approximate center of the square;  or
    
    
      (B) Not less than one hundred six (106) minutes per inch and not more than one hundred twenty (120) minutes per inch;  provided, that an alternative method of subsurface sewage disposal is used.  The percolation holes used to determine this rate must be located at the intersection of lines in a grid pattern with maximum perpendicular distances of twenty-five feet (25′) between the lines of the grid.  Each hole shall be considered reasonably representative of a square area of six hundred twenty-five square feet (625 sq. ft.) which includes that hole in the appropriate center of the square;
    
  
  
    (2) All percolation tests shall be performed by a soil scientist, engineer, registered professional environmentalist, professional geologist, registered environmental health specialist/registered sanitarian with more than five (5) years experience in a subsurface sewage regulatory program and who has received credentials from the National Environmental Health Association, or surveyor licensed in this state and must be carried out in accordance with the regulations of the department;
  
  
    (3) The grid pattern referred to in subdivision (c)(1) shall be located within the area to be utilized for the disposal field and reserve area in such a manner as to provide reliable information regarding the percolation rate of the entire area to be utilized for the disposal field and reserve area;
  
  
    (4) If a percolation test hole within the test grid is unacceptable because the depth to rock is too little, that fact shall not necessarily mean that the remainder of the area within the test grid is unacceptable, only that the area represented by that particular hole is unacceptable;
  
  
    (5) The department shall report the actual average percolation rate, as determined by the percolation test, on the subsurface sewage disposal system permit.  The actual average percolation rate shall be determined by averaging only the test results from the area actually to be covered by the permit;
  
  
    (6) The disposal field shall contain a minimum of three hundred seventy square feet (370 sq. ft.) of trench bottom area per bedroom;  and
  
  
    (7) When a permit applicant intends to rely upon the results of percolation tests, the applicant shall not be required to perform a high intensity soils evaluation of the area proposed for the subsurface sewage disposal system.  However, for proposed subdivisions, the applicant shall submit a plat showing the results of a soils evaluation performed by a soil scientist certified by the department, the sole purpose of which is to determine which portions, if any, of the area proposed for the disposal field and reserve area are unsuitable for percolation tests because of depth to rock, slope or water problems.  For individual lots which are not part of a subdivision, the general soils evaluation described in the preceding sentence is not required, but an evaluation of the lot may be performed by an employee of the department without preparing a plat.  The percolation tests used to determine the actual average percolation rate of the area to be used for the disposal field and reserve area shall be run after the submission of the general soils evaluation, and the department shall be notified at least three (3) days prior to the day that these tests will be run.  If the general soils evaluation concludes that a particular area is unsuitable for percolation tests, the applicant may then perform a high-intensity soils evaluation of that area to gather additional information which may show that the area is suitable for percolation tests.  When a proposed area is determined to be unsuitable for percolation tests, that area may be further evaluated to determine its suitability for an alternative subsurface sewage disposal system, and where found appropriate, shall be approved by the department for an alternative system.
  

  (d) Permits for the construction of subsurface sewage disposal systems shall be issued for single family residence lots in subdivisions which were approved by the local health authority prior to April 15, 1986, in accordance with the following requirements:
  
    (1) Permits for lots within subdivisions approved prior to July 10, 1974, shall be based upon soils or percolation data, where such data are available for the recorded plat of the subdivision, and systems shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements authorized by subdivisions (a)(2) and (3), except for those provisions dealing with duplicate area and slope;
  
  
    (2) Permits for lots with subdivisions approved July 10, 1974, or after, shall be based upon soils or percolation data, where such data are available for the recorded plat of the subdivision, and systems shall be constructed in accordance with the requirements authorized by subdivisions (a)(2) and (3);
  
  
    (3) In the absence of any data on file or on the recorded plat, permits shall be issued and systems constructed in accordance with the requirements authorized by subdivisions (a)(2) and (3), except those provisions dealing with duplicate area and slope.  The disposal field for these systems shall contain at least three hundred seventy square feet (370 sq. ft.) of trench bottom area per bedroom;  or, if the lot does not have sufficient area to install this amount, the maximum square footage that can be installed;  provided, that an absolute minimum of two hundred square feet (200 sq. ft.) per bedroom must be installed.  The permit shall note that the system is for an approved subdivision without adequate available soils or percolation data;  and
  
  
    (4) The eighteen inch (18″) requirement of subsection (f) does not apply to systems approved under this subsection (d), or to subdivisions approved by the commissioner prior to July 1, 1990.
  

  
    (e)(1) In the adoption and promulgation of rules and regulations under this section, the standards for subsurface sewerage disposal systems shall, in counties with a population of not less than twelve thousand three hundred fifty (12,350) nor more than twelve thousand four hundred (12,400), according to the 1970 federal census or any subsequent federal census, provide that the media for the disposal fields shall consist of crushed rock or gravel varying in size from three-fourths inch ( 3/4 ″) to two and one-half inches (2 1/2 ″);  or of creek gravel;  or of other material authorized for substitution by the county sanitation officer.
  
  
    (2) In the adoption and promulgation of rules and regulations under this section, the standards for subsurface sewage disposal systems shall, in counties with a population of not less than six thousand (6,000) nor more than six thousand one hundred twenty-five (6,125), and in counties with a population of not less than nine thousand six hundred fifty (9,650) nor more than nine thousand seven hundred fifty (9,750), if approved by a two-thirds ( 2/3 ) vote of the legislative body of such county before September 6, 1983, all according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census, provide that the media for the disposal fields shall consist of crushed rock or gravel varying in size from three-fourths inch ( 3/4 ″) to two and one-half inches (2 1/2 ″);  or of creek gravel;  or of other material authorized for substitution by the county sanitation officer.
  

  (f) It is permissible to use blasting to remove unwanted rock in order to install a septic tank or a solid line leading to the tank or from the tank to the disposal field.  Where blasting is used in the construction of the disposal field, no section of pipe designed to let, or capable of letting, water escape through perforations, joints, or any other opening shall be located within ten feet (10′) horizontally of rock which has been blasted, and an anti-seep collar shall be installed at the junction of the perforated pipe and a solid pipe passing through the zone of blasted rock in such a manner as to prevent sewage discharged from perforations in the perforated pipe from moving laterally from the perforated pipe toward the blasted rock.  In addition to the other requirements contained in the regulations, in no case shall any section of pipe designed to let, or capable of letting, water escape through perforations, joints, or any other opening be located within eighteen inches (18″) (at least twelve inches (12″) shall be undisturbed soil) vertically of rock in the area of karst geology (however the department may specify a lesser distance in a non-karst area) or within three feet (3′) horizontally of rock which has not been blasted.  This subsection (f) is applicable to all subsurface sewage disposal system permits issued by the commissioner.

  
    (g)(1) Where the undisturbed soil layer above rock is between eighteen inches (18″) and twenty-four inches (24″) deep, a low pressure pipe system may be installed;  provided, that no portion of any seepage trench (i.e., aggregate-encased-perforated pipe) is within three feet (3′) horizontally of rock which has not been blasted and ten feet (10′) horizontally of rock which has been blasted.  The elevation of each perforated distribution pipe in the low pressure pipe system shall be the same as the elevation of the natural soil in the vicinity of each pipe.  Each perforated pipe shall be installed on a bed of aggregate located in a trench excavated six inches (6″) wide and six inches (6″) deep into undisturbed natural soil.  Each perforated pipe shall be covered by two inches (2″) of aggregate.  Each seepage trench shall be separated five feet (5′) horizontally and covered with at least twelve inches (12″) of compatible soil;  provided, that all vegetation is removed from the original soil surface and it is plowed to a depth of three inches (3″) with a chisel plow prior to the placement of the added soil.  The covering soil shall extend, at a minimum depth of twelve inches (12″), for a distance of five feet (5′) beyond the perimeter of the area containing the seepage trenches and then taper to natural soil level with a maximum side slope for the covering soil of three (3) to one (1) (i.e., three feet (3′) horizontal to one foot (1′) vertical).  At least five (5) observation tubes shall be provided by installing fourteen inch (14″) long sections of one and one half inch (1.5″) diameter pipe that will extend from the natural soil surface to above the surface of the covering soil.  The location of the observation tubes will be specified for each system by a soil scientist certified by the department.
  
  
    (2) Before any system may be approved under this subsection (g), a soils evaluation must be made by a soil scientist certified by the department, and the department must find that the soil is sufficiently permeable to allow proper absorption of the sewage into the soil.  To the extent they are not inconsistent with this subsection (g), the general regulations governing low pressure pipe systems are applicable to systems installed pursuant to this subsection (g).
  
  
    (3) Any system approved under this subsection (g) shall be identified on a restrictive covenant filed with the local register of deeds for the property served by the system.
  

  (h) Recognizing the acute need for environmentally safe and economically feasible on-site wastewater disposal systems for sites with marginal soil resources, and further recognizing the potential for development of numerous satisfactory designs, the department is charged to continually strive to identify and/or develop design and operating criteria for systems that have potential for functioning properly on sites with limited soil depth above a limiting horizon (e.g., fragipan, perched water table, rock).

  (i) When the undisturbed soil layer above rock is between twenty-four inches (24″) and thirty-six inches (36″) deep, a conventional disposal system may be installed, if the following requirements are met:
  
    (1) The depth of gravel in the trench shall be either eight inches (8″), ten inches (10″) or twelve inches (12″) with a minimum depth underneath the pipe of three inches (3″) and with a minimum depth above the pipe of one inch (1″).  As the depth of gravel is reduced to ten inches (10″) or eight inches (8″), the length of the trenches will increase proportionately such that the total cubic footage and the infiltrative surface on the side wall of the trenches will remain constant;
  
  
    (2) The original soil surface shall be at least seven inches (7″) above the top of the gravel in the trench;
  
  
    (3) There shall be at least nine inches (9″) of undisturbed soil between the trench bottom and rock;
  
  
    (4) The disposal field area shall have at least ten inches (10″) of backfill above the elevation of the gravel in the trench.  A maximum of three inches (3″) of the backfill may be compatible soil fill;  provided, that all vegetation is removed from the original soil surface and it is plowed to a depth of three inches (3″) with a plow prior to the placement of the added soil.  The covering soil shall extend, at the required depth, for a distance of five feet (5′) beyond the perimeter of the area containing the seepage trenches and then taper to natural soil level with a slope for the covering soil of three feet (3′) horizontal to one foot (1′) vertical or flatter;  and
  
  
    (5) The eighteen inch (18″) requirement of subsection (f) does not apply to systems approved under this subsection (i).  To the extent they are not inconsistent with this subsection (i), the general regulations governing conventional disposal systems are applicable to systems installed pursuant to this subsection (i).
  

  (j) In addition to the department's authorization for systems which have gained the approval of the National Sanitation Foundation, the department shall also authorize the use of not more than fifty (50) units of any system which meets the National Sanitation Foundation Standard 40 conducted by a research I institution that has an accredited civil and environmental engineering program;  provided, that the applicant for any such unit shall, in addition to all other fees prescribed, pay to the department a special inspection fee of one hundred dollars ($100).

  (k) Permits shall be issued for the repair of any system in existence prior to July 1, 1990, pursuant to statutes, rules and regulations in effect on June 30, 1990.

  (l) The commissioner shall use a portion of the fees imposed and collected pursuant to state law to fund a position in the division of ground water protection.  The person filling this position shall perform the following tasks:
  
    (1) Determine the number of lots approved by the local health authority and/or the commissioner prior to July 1, 1990, in at least ten (10) counties in this state, which counties shall be selected by the department as representative of counties which have the greatest need for alternative subsurface sewage disposal systems;
  
  
    (2) Gather and compile all readily available information, from other states and from throughout this state, concerning all alternative subsurface sewage disposal systems which might feasibly be used in this state, and make this information available to members of the public;  and
  
  
    (3) Communicate on a regular basis with members of the public concerning the availability, cost, environmental advantages, and other factors relevant to alternative subsurface sewage disposal systems."

    (2) Regardless of the kind or amount of additional jurisdiction a Class 7 judge may have, the judge shall not receive annual supplements in excess of ten thousand dollars ($10,000).
  

  
    (e)(1) On July 1, 1991, the base salaries established by this section shall be adjusted in accordance with subdivision (e)(2) to reflect the percentage of change in the average consumer price index (all items--city average) as published by the United States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics, between calendar year 1989 and calendar year 1990.  Each succeeding July 1, a similar adjustment shall be made upon the percentage of change in the average consumer price index between the two (2) calendar years preceding July 1 of the year in which the adjustment is made.  However, no reduction shall be made by way of adjustment on account of any decrease in the average consumer price index between the two (2) successive calendar years.
  
  
    (2) For each two percent (2%) increase in the average consumer price index between two (2) successive calendar years, the base salaries shall be adjusted by one percent (1%).  No annual adjustment shall exceed four percent (4%) regardless of the increase in the average consumer price index between any two (2) successive calendar years.  Annual adjustments shall be made upon the base salary set out in subsection (a) and the adjustment shall not include any supplement that may be received pursuant to subsection (b) or (c).
  

  (f) The compensation, supplement and annual adjustment provisions of this section are to be construed as minimum levels.  Nothing in this part shall be construed as prohibiting a county, by private act, from compensating its general sessions judge or judges at levels in excess of what is required by this part.  Any private or public act in effect on September 1, 1990, that provides greater compensation for a general sessions judge than is required by this section shall, to the extent of the judge's amount of compensation, prevail over this part, and the base salary of the judge shall be the salary paid to the holder of that office on August 31, 1990, pursuant to such public or private act, plus a percentage increase equivalent to the same percentage increase given by subsection (a) to a judge of a Class 6 county.  Nothing in this part shall prevent a county from establishing and funding the position of part-time general sessions judge in a county with a full-time general sessions judge.

  (g) Notwithstanding any provision of law or this part to the contrary, no judge of a general sessions court shall be paid a salary that is greater than the salary paid to a judge of a circuit court.

  
    (h)(1) Effective September 1, 1998, the annual salary for a general sessions court judge shall be increased over the annual compensation and supplements and annual adjustments that each judge actually received as of August 31, 1998, by the lesser of:
    
      (A) Ten thousand dollars ($10,000);  or
    
    
      (B) Twenty percent (20%) of the annual compensation and supplements and annual adjustments as of August 31, 1998.
    
  
  
    (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, each full-time general sessions court judge in a county shall receive the same compensation as the most highly compensated general sessions court judge in that county if the judges have the same jurisdiction.
  
  
    (3) Instead of the annual adjustments authorized in subsection (e), on July 1, 1999, and each succeeding July 1, the base salaries as adjusted annually and supplements as adjusted annually established by this section shall be adjusted in accordance with 
§ 8-23-103
      .
  
  
    
      (4)(A) The compensation, supplement and annual adjustment provisions of this section are to be construed as minimum levels.  The compensation schedule established by this part is a comprehensive plan, and no salary supplement in excess of the supplements provided by this part shall be available to a general sessions judge unless expressly provided and funded by a private act.
    
    
      (B) Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a judge of a court of general sessions may not be paid compensation based on both this part and the compensation provisions in a private act.
    
    
      (C) Nothing in this part shall be construed as prohibiting a county, by private act, from compensating its general sessions judge or judges at levels in excess of what is required by this part.  Any private or public act in effect on September 1, 1998, that provides greater compensation for a general sessions judge than is required by this section shall, to the extent of the judge's amount of compensation, prevail over this part, and the base salary of the judge shall be the salary paid to the holder of that office on August 31, 1998, pursuant to the public or private act plus a percentage increase equivalent to the same percentage increase given by subdivision (h)(1) to a judge of a Class 6 county determined as of August 31, 1998.
    
  

  
    (i)(1) Notwithstanding any law or public chapter to the contrary, effective September 1, 2006, the annual salary for a general sessions court judge who is compensated under this section shall be increased over the annual compensation and supplements and annual adjustments that each judge actually received as of August 31, 2006, by the lesser of:
    
      (A) Ten thousand dollars ($10,000);  or
    
    
      (B) Twenty percent (20%) of the annual compensation and supplements and annual adjustments as of August 31, 2006.
    
  
  
    (2) A judge of a general sessions court may not be paid compensation based on both this part and the compensation provisions of a private act.
  
  
    (3) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection (i) to the contrary, each general sessions court judge in a Class 1 county who is compensated under this section shall receive the same compensation as the most highly compensated general sessions court judge in a Class 1 county who is compensated under this section.
  
  
    (4) Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection (i) to the contrary, each general sessions court judge in a Class 2-7 county who is compensated under this section and who receives the maximum amount of annual supplements shall receive the same compensation as the most highly compensated general sessions court judge in the same county classification who is compensated under this section.  All other general sessions court judges in Class 2-7 counties who are compensated under this section shall receive the same compensation as the most highly compensated general sessions court judge in the same county classification with the same jurisdiction who is compensated under this section;  provided, however, that no judge shall be paid a salary that reflects jurisdictional supplements that the judge is not entitled to exercise by law.
  
  
    (5) Instead of the annual adjustments authorized in subsection (e), on July 1, 2007, and each succeeding July 1, the annual compensation and supplements and annual adjustments established under this section shall be adjusted in accordance with 
§ 8-23-103
      .
  
  
    (6) Nothing in this part shall be construed as prohibiting a county, by public or private act, from compensating its general sessions court judge or judges at levels in excess of what is required by this section.  Any public or private act in effect on September 1, 2006, that provides greater compensation for a general sessions court judge than is required by this section shall, to the extent of the judge's amount of compensation, prevail over this section.  Notwithstanding any provision of this subsection (i) to the contrary, a general sessions court judge in a Class 6 county who receives no supplements and who is compensated under the provisions of a private or public act and not under this section shall receive the same increase provided in subdivision (i)(1).
  
  
    (7) On or before July 15, 2006, each general sessions court judge shall certify to the administrative office of the courts (AOC) the total amount of the judge's actual compensation as of August 31, 2006, the jurisdictions exercised by the judge, the legal basis for exercising the jurisdiction, and whether the judge is compensated under this section or under a public or private act.  Included in the information submitted by the judge to the AOC shall be a certification of the county's chief financial officer of the actual compensation of the judge as of August 31, 2006, or other verifiable proof of the judge's actual compensation.  When all judges have certified the required information to the AOC, the AOC shall report to each general sessions court judge the amount of compensation to be paid to the general sessions court judge beginning on September 1, 2006, based on the information provided by the judge.  Thereafter, when a new court is created, a new judge takes office or any similar change occurs, or upon the completion of a new federal census, the administrative office of the courts shall report the amount of compensation to be paid to any judge affected by the change.
  
  
    (8) The judges of the general sessions court in any county with a population of not less than three hundred eighty-two thousand (382,000) nor more than three hundred eighty-two thousand one hundred (382,100), according to the 2000 federal census or any subsequent federal census, and that has a charter form of government shall receive the same annual compensation as the general sessions judges in those counties with a metropolitan form of government and a population in excess of five hundred thousand (500,000), according to the 2000 federal census or any subsequent federal census.
  
  
    (9) No general sessions judge who engages in the private practice of law shall receive any increase in salary pursuant to this subsection (i), if the judge is prohibited by law from engaging in private practice.
  

  (j) Notwithstanding any provision of law or this part to the contrary, no judge of a general sessions court shall be paid a salary which is greater than the salary paid to a judge of a circuit court."

    (2) Districts must be substantially equal in population in accordance with constitutional requirements for “one (1) person one (1) vote” as judicially interpreted to apply to state legislative districts;
  
  
    (3) Geographic areas, boundaries and population counts used for redistricting shall be based on the 2010 federal decennial census;
  
  
    (4) Districts must be contiguous and contiguity by water is sufficient, and, toward that end, if any voting district or other geographical entity designated as a portion of a district is found to be noncontiguous with the larger portion of such district, it shall be constituted a portion of the district smallest in population to which it is contiguous;
  
  
    (5) No more than thirty (30) counties may be split to attach to other counties or parts of counties to form multi-county districts;  and
  
  
    (6) The redistricting plan will comply with the Voting Rights Act and the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution.
  

  (c) Until the next enumeration of qualified voters and apportionment of representatives, the state house of representatives shall be composed as follows:

Cities and Towns § 6-20-101,"(a) In all cities that adopt chapters 18-22 of this title, commissioners as provided for in this charter shall be elected in the manner prescribed in this chapter.

  (b) If such city or territory has a population of five thousand (5,000) or more according to the last federal census, there shall be elected at the first election five (5) commissioners, the three (3) receiving the highest number of votes to hold office for four (4) years, and the other two (2) for two (2) years.  If such city or territory has a population of less than five thousand (5,000) according to the last federal census, there shall be elected at the first election three (3) commissioners, the two (2) receiving the highest number of votes to hold office for four (4) years and the third for two (2) years.  The term of all commissioners thereafter elected shall be for four (4) years, or until their successors are elected and qualified.  Any such city that has a population of not less than two thousand nine hundred twenty (2,920) nor more than two thousand nine hundred twenty-two (2,922), according to the federal census of 1960 or any subsequent federal census, five (5) commissioners shall be elected as provided for cities of more than five thousand (5,000) population.  The deadline for filing nominating petitions for the first commissioners is thirty-five (35) days before the incorporation election.

  (c) Any city having a population of less than five thousand (5,000) shall have the option of increasing the number of commissioners to five (5) by ordinance.  In the next regular city election after the adoption of such an ordinance, voters shall be entitled to vote for three (3) commissioners, or four (4) commissioners, as the case may be, and at the same election the approval of the ordinance shall also be submitted to the voters.  If a majority of those voting on the ordinance shall be for approval and the number of commissioners to be elected is three (3), the two (2) receiving the highest number of votes shall hold office for four (4) years, and the third for two (2) years.  If the number of commissioners to be elected is four (4), the two (2) receiving the highest number of votes shall hold office for four (4) years, and the other two (2) for two (2) years.  The terms of all commissioners thereafter elected shall be for four (4) years, or until their successors are elected and qualified.  If a majority of those voting on the ordinance shall not be for approval, the ordinance shall be null and void, and the results of the election shall be certified as though the election were for one (1) commissioner, or two (2) commissioners, as the case may be, and as though no ordinance had been adopted.  Any city that has previously adopted an ordinance approved by the voters pursuant to this subsection (c) increasing the number of commissioners from three (3) to five (5), may, after six (6) years, adopt an ordinance to decrease the number of commissioners from five (5) to three (3) following the same procedure.  If a majority of those persons voting on the ordinance shall be for approval, then the number of commissioners shall be reduced to three (3).  Any such ordinance providing for a decrease in the number of commissioners shall not operate to abbreviate the term of office of any elected commissioner.

  (d) An ordinance increasing the number of commissioners to five (5) may also be submitted to the voters in an election on the question that the board of commissioners directs the county election commission to hold.  At such election, voters shall be entitled to vote for two (2) commissioners to serve until the next regular city election.  If a majority of those voting on the ordinance shall be for approval, the two (2) candidates for commissioner receiving the highest number of votes shall be declared elected.  At the next regular city election if the number of commissioners to be elected is four (4), the three (3) receiving the highest number of votes shall hold office for four (4) years, and the fourth for two (2) years;  if the number of commissioners to be elected is three (3), they shall hold office for four (4) years.  The terms of all commissioners thereafter elected shall be for four (4) years, or until their successors are elected and qualified.  If a majority of those voting on the ordinance in the special election shall not be for approval, the ordinance and the election of the two (2) commissioners shall be null and void.

  (e) Notwithstanding subsections (a)-(d), a city with a population of not less than six hundred (600) nor more than six hundred twenty-five (625) persons, according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census, located in a county with a population in excess of seven hundred thousand (700,000) persons, also according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census, shall elect all commissioners at one time for a four-year term so that the city may be spared the expense of conducting elections every two (2) years.  In order to effectuate this provision, all commissioners to be elected at the 1983 election shall be elected to a two-year term only, to serve until the 1985 election at which time, and every four (4) years thereafter, all commissioners shall be elected to four-year terms.  Subsection (e) shall have no effect unless approved by a two-thirds ( 2/3 ) vote of the governing body of any municipality to which it may apply.

  (f) Cities that have adopted 
      § 6-20-201(a)(3)
     to provide for popular election of the mayor shall have two (2) or four (4) commissioners as the case may be under subsection (b) or (c).

  (g) Notwithstanding subsections (a)-(f), any city incorporated under or adopting this charter may, by ordinance, choose to elect the members of the board of commissioners by district.  If the board chooses to elect commissioners by district, the board shall by ordinance create contiguous single-member districts equal to the number of commissioners.  The districts shall be equitably apportioned according to population.  The establishment of the districts and the fixing of their boundaries shall be accomplished not less than twelve (12) months prior to the regular city election at which commissioners are to be elected, and any change in district boundaries shall also be accomplished within this time limitation.  The board shall, within ten (10) years from the initial establishment of districts and at least once in every ten (10) years thereafter, reapportion the districts so that the apportionment shall comply with the requirements of this section.  One (1) commissioner shall be elected from each district of the city.  The ordinance providing that the commissioners will be chosen by districts may provide that each district commissioner will be elected by the voters of the city at-large or by only the voters of the district.  A person must reside in a district to run for or hold the office of commissioner from that district.  The ordinance providing that commissioners will be chosen by district may also provide for transition provisions, including increasing the terms of the number of commissioners necessary so that the initial election from all districts shall take place at the same time.  The ordinance may provide that all commissioners initially elected serve four-year terms or that some serve four (4) years and some serve two (2) years.  If some are elected for two (2) years, their successors shall be elected for four (4) years, so that the commissioners have staggered terms.  After the initial election, all commissioners shall be elected for four-year terms.

  (h) Any city having a population of more than twenty thousand (20,000), according to the last federal census, shall have the option of increasing the number of commissioners to seven (7) by ordinance.  Upon adoption of such an ordinance, it shall be filed with the county election commission, which shall submit approval of the ordinance to the voters of the city at the next general election or regular city election that follows the filing period required pursuant to 
      § 2-3-204(b)
    .  If a majority of those voting on the ordinance are not for approval, the ordinance shall be null and void.  If a majority of those voting on the ordinance are for approval, then at the next regular city election, voters shall be entitled to vote for four (4) commissioners, or five (5) commissioners, as the case may be, in order to provide for a total of seven (7) commissioners.  If the number of commissioners to be elected is four (4), each shall hold office for four (4) years.  If the number of commissioners to be elected is five (5), the three (3) receiving the highest number of votes shall hold office for four (4) years, and the other two (2) for two (2) years.  The terms of all commissioners thereafter elected shall be for four (4) years, or until their successors are elected and qualified.  An ordinance approved by the voters pursuant to this section may not be repealed or amended."

Consolidated Governments and Local Governmental Functions and Entities § 7-60-102,"(a) It is hereby found and declared that there continues to exist throughout the state a seriously inadequate supply of decent, safe and sanitary dwelling accommodations, primarily accommodations for persons and families of lower and moderate income.  This condition is contrary to the public interest and threatens the health, safety, welfare, comfort and security of the people of the state and is inimical to the sound growth and the development of its communities.  An adequate supply of housing of a variety of housing types serving persons and families of all income levels and properly planned and related to public transportation, public facilities, public utilities and sources of employment and service is essential to the orderly growth and prosperity of the state and the state's communities.  Present patterns and methods of providing housing unduly limit the housing options for many persons in the state.

  (b) It is further found and declared that one (1) major cause of this condition has been recurrent, cyclical shortages of funds in private banking channels available for residential mortgages.  Such shortages contribute to reductions in construction starts of new residential units.  In addition, these cyclical shortages make the sale and purchase of existing residential units difficult in many parts of the state, especially by those persons of lower and moderate income.  The ordinary operations of private enterprise have not in the past corrected these conditions.

  (c) It is further found and declared that the reduction in residential construction starts associated with such shortages causes a condition of substantial unemployment and underemployment in the construction industry that results in hardships to many individuals and families, wastes human resources, increases the public assistance burdens of the state, counties, and municipalities, impairs the security of family life, impedes the economic and physical development of counties, cities and communities and adversely affects the welfare and prosperity of all the people of the state.  A stable supply of adequate funds for residential mortgages is required to spur new housing starts in an orderly and sustained manner and thereby to reduce the hazards of unemployment and underemployment in the construction industry.  The unaided operations of private enterprise, especially during periods of cyclical shortages of capital, have not always been able to meet and cannot always meet the need for a stable supply of adequate funds for residential mortgage financing.

  (d) It is further found and declared that these conditions associated with such recurrent shortages of residential mortgage funds contribute to the persistence of slums and blight and to the deterioration of the quality of the environment and living conditions of a large number of persons residing in the state of Tennessee, have adversely affected the economy of the state as a whole and of the counties, cities and communities in the state, and are contrary to the declared policy of the state to promote a vigorous and growing economy, to prevent economic stagnation, to increase revenues to the state and to its counties, cities and other communities, and to achieve stable local economies.

  (e) Based upon the experience of the past, shortages of funds for residential mortgages in the private investment system can be expected to recur from time to time in varying degrees of severity with the adverse consequences described in subsections (a)-(d).  To bring greater stability to the residential construction industry and related industries, and thus to assure a steady flow of production of new housing units, counties or metropolitan governments having a population of two hundred thousand (200,000) or more, according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census, shall be given the power to raise funds from private investors through issuance of bonds and notes to:
  
    (1) Make funds available for permanent mortgage financing of housing for lower and moderate income persons and families;
  
  
    (2) Purchase existing mortgages from lending institutions within the state and direct an amount equal to the proceeds from the liquidated mortgage investments into new mortgages on residential housing for lower and moderate income persons and families;
  
  
    (3) Enter into advance commitments with lending institutions to purchase mortgage loans for housing for lower and moderate income persons and families made to such persons and families;
  
  
    (4) Make loans to lending institutions that require that substantially all of the proceeds of the loans be used for the making of mortgages for housing for lower and moderate income persons and families;
  
  
    (5) Make “qualified home improvement loans” not to exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) per dwelling unit to finance alterations, repairs and improvements on or in connection with the existing residence by the owner of the residence, but only if such items substantially protect or improve the basic livability or energy efficiency of the property;  and
  
  
    (6) Make funds available for housing loans for veterans who qualify as persons and families of low and moderate income by including in each issue of bonds sold under this chapter a United States department of veterans' affairs guaranteed loan program.
  

  (f) The general assembly hereby finds that the interests of the citizens of the state and the purposes of this chapter shall be best served by, and it is hereby determined that the state ceiling, as defined in the federal law, applicable to the state for any calendar year pursuant to the federal law shall be allocated among the governmental units in the state in accordance with title 9, chapter 20.

  (g) The general assembly further finds that the authority and powers conferred under this chapter and the expenditure of public moneys pursuant to this chapter constitute a serving of a valid public purpose and that the enactment of the provisions set forth in this chapter is in the public interest and is hereby so declared to be such as a matter of express legislative determination."

Professions of the Healing Arts § 63-6-228,"(a) This section shall be known and may be cited as the “Tennessee Community Health Management Information System Law of 1993.”

  (b) As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:
  
    (1) “Collected data” means health care data consisting of all information, interviews or other reports, statements, memoranda or other information furnished from all sources and in whatever form to the quality assessment committee, together with the records, reports, proceedings and other information used by the quality assessment committee to reach its conclusions in the form of releasable data as defined in this section;
  
  
    (2) “Community health management information system (CHMIS)” means any broad based organization, including, but not limited to, providers of health care goods and services, payors for health care goods and services, including insurors and employers, and users of health care goods and services, whose goal is to monitor and improve the level of community wellness and the quality of health care rendered by providers of health care delivery services and the financial reimbursement systems in a county having a population in excess of eight hundred thousand (800,000), according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal census;
  
  
    (3) “Quality assessment committee” means a committee of a CHMIS consisting primarily of physicians and other providers of health care, with insurors and employers, whose purpose is to collect, analyze and refine health care data as part of the CHMIS;  and
  
  
    (4) “Releasable data” means summaries and conclusions of collected data of the quality assessment committee determined by such quality assessment committee to be scientifically valid and formally delivered to the quality executive committee to achieve the purposes of the CHMIS.
  

  (c) It is the stated policy of Tennessee to encourage each CHMIS to candidly, conscientiously and objectively monitor and improve the level of community wellness and quality of health care delivery services and financial reimbursement systems.  Tennessee further recognizes that confidentiality is essential both to effective functioning of the CHMIS and to continued improvement in the access to, the efficiency of and the quality of health care services.  As incentive for the providers, payors and users of health care services to participate in a quality assessment committee, such quality assessment committee must be protected from liability for its good faith efforts.  To this end, a quality assessment committee of a CHMIS should be granted certain immunities relating to its actions undertaken as part of its responsibility to collect, analyze and refine health care data.  In instances of a quality assessment committee examining the appropriateness of physicians' fees, this immunity must also extend to restraint of trade claims under title 47, chapter 25.

  
    (d)(1) All health care professional associations and societies and other organizations, including insurors and employers, institutions, foundations, entities and associated communities as identified in subsection (c), physicians, registered nurses, hospitals, hospital administrators and employees, members of boards of directors or trustees of any publicly supported or privately supported hospital or other such provider of health care, any person acting as a staff member of a quality assessment committee of a CHMIS, any person under a contract or other formal agreement with a quality assessment committee of a CHMIS, any person who participates with or assists a quality assessment committee of a CHMIS with respect to its functions or any other individual appointed to any quality assessment committee as such term is described in subsection (b) shall be immune from liability to any patient, individual or organization for furnishing information, data, reports or records to any such quality assessment committee or for damages resulting from any decision, opinions, actions and proceedings rendered, entered or acted upon by a quality assessment committee undertaken or performed within the scope or function of the duties of such quality assessment committees, if made or taken in good faith and without malice and on the basis of facts reasonably known or reasonably believed to exist.
  
  
    (2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (d)(1), any person providing information to a quality assessment committee of a CHMIS regarding the analysis and refinement of health care data shall be immune from liability to any person, unless such information is false and the person providing it had actual knowledge of such falsity.
  

  (e) All collected data of the CHMIS are declared to be privileged and shall not be public records nor be available for court subpoena or for discovery proceedings.  The CHMIS, through a quality executive committee or similar committee, shall establish particular categories of health care data and refinement periods for each category of health care data, whether such data is collected data or releasable data.  Releasable data shall be subject to the privileges and limitations of collected data for refinement periods as determined by the quality executive committee.  When the refinement period has expired for a particular category of releasable data, then such immunities and privileges set forth in this subsection (e) shall no longer apply to the releasable data for such category.  The disclosure of confidential, privileged quality assessment committee information to original sources during the refinement period, or as a report by the quality assessment committee to the quality executive committee, the CHMIS board of directors or another executive committee within the CHMIS, prior to the expiration of the refinement period does not constitute either a waiver of confidentiality or privilege.  Nothing contained in this subsection (e) applies to records made in the regular course of business by a hospital or other provider of health care and information, documents or records otherwise available from original sources are not to be construed as immune from discovery or use in any civil proceedings merely because they were presented during the refinement period of the quality assessment committee."

§ 7-82-401
      ;
  
  
    (3) It is the express intent of the general assembly that the review granted in this subsection (a) shall be a substantive and meaningful review.  In order to accomplish this intention, the utility district shall take no action that will result in contractually binding the district or obligating the district to issue bonds that would require a rate increase, until the district shall have first given notice to the customers of the district of such anticipated action;  and
  
  
    (4) The Uniform Administrative Procedures Act shall apply to all procedures and proceedings coming before the utility management review board pursuant to this subsection (a), to the extent not inconsistent with this chapter.
  

  (b) In those counties and districts specified in subdivision (b)(5), the following shall apply:

    (2) The authority shall review those petitions pertaining to rates as fully as in the case of private utility companies;  provided, that the burden shall be upon the petitioners to show that the rates are discriminatory or unjust and unreasonable.  In considering rate petitions, the authority shall take no action that adversely impairs the obligation of contracts or payment of existing bonds by such district, and may, within its sound legal discretion, assess costs of such hearings as equity and justice may demand;
  
  
    (3) It is the express intent of the general assembly that the review granted in this subsection (b) shall be a substantive and meaningful review.  In order to accomplish this intention, the utility district shall take no action that will result in contractually binding the district or obligating the district to issue bonds that would require a rate increase, until the district shall have first given notice to the users of the district of such anticipated action;
  
  
    (4) The Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5, shall apply to all procedures and proceedings coming before the authority pursuant to this subsection (b), to the extent not inconsistent with this chapter;  and

  (e) The failure of a prescriber or, where appropriate, a supervising physician to respond to the department's request for information in a timely fashion may be a cause for disciplinary action by the prescriber's, or where appropriate the supervising physician's, licensing board and may include a penalty of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) per day for failure to respond or failure to respond in a timely manner.

  (f) Tax receivables and the penalties and interest accrued on the tax receivables shall be exempt from taxation by any governmental entity.  The real property affected by any tax receivable shall not be exempt from taxation by reason of this section.

      (C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, in those counties in which all students in grades kindergarten through twelve (K-12) are eligible to be served by city and special school systems, the county shall not be required to operate a separate county school system, nor shall it be necessary that a county school board be elected or otherwise constituted.
    
  
  
    (3) No additional special school districts may be created after April 30, 1982, but existing operating districts may merge or consolidate.  This shall not affect the powers of cities under part 4 of this chapter if the county in which the city is located has fewer districts than those permitted in subdivision (b)(1).

(B)(i) Any other district in a county may merge with any contiguous system that will continue to operate under subdivision (b)(4)(A).  The merger shall occur no later than July 1, 1983, and shall be accomplished by majority vote of the board of education of the system to be abolished.  The merger shall not be effective unless the board of education of the system with which merger is sought approves the merger by a majority vote of the board, and unless the city governing body by a majority vote approves the merger in the case of a merger with a city school system;
      
      
(ii) If a district that will be abolished on July 1, 1983, has not merged into a continuing system by July 1, 1983, it shall be merged into the county system on that date;

.
    
  
  
    (5) Elementary schools operated by any school system abolished under this subsection (b) shall continue to be operated as elementary schools by the successor system following the abolishment of any system under this part;  provided, that this shall not be construed to require the continuance of such schools if they should be destroyed or become unusable because of fire or safety violations or should fail to meet the minimum standards of the state board of education.
  
  
    (6) The county board of education of any county affected by this subsection (b) shall include persons representing and residing in the area served by every school district that is abolished under this part in the same percentage that such districts relate to the total number of public school systems in such county.
  
  
    (7) In the event of consolidation of districts in accordance with this subsection (b), the consolidated system shall continue to operate grades kindergarten through eight (K-8) by local instruction in local school buildings.  This subdivision (b)(7) shall only apply to counties having a population of not less than fourteen thousand nine hundred forty (14,940) nor more than fifteen thousand (15,000), according to the 1980 federal census or any subsequent federal census.

    (2) In case any building or structure is or is proposed to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, converted or maintained, or any building, structure or land is or is proposed to be used in violation of any ordinance enacted under this part and part 3 of this chapter, the building commissioner, municipal counsel or other appropriate authority of the municipality, or any adjacent or neighboring property owner who would be specially damaged by such violation, may, in addition to other remedies, institute injunction, mandamus or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance or use, or to correct or abate such violation, or to prevent the occupancy of the building, structure or land.

    (2) When the use permitted to continue to expand, or to be rebuilt pursuant to any subsection of this section is an off-premises sign, such use shall not preclude any new or additional conforming use or structure on the property on which the sign structure is located or on any adjacent property under the same ownership;  provided, however, that any such new or additional use or structure does not result in any violations of the applicable zoning restrictions other than those nonconformities associated with the off- premises sign as allowed under this subdivision (b)(2).
  

  (c) Industrial, commercial or other business establishments in operation and permitted to operate under zoning regulations or exceptions thereto in effect immediately preceding a change in zoning shall be allowed to expand operations and construct additional facilities which involve an actual continuance and expansion of the activities of the industry or business which were permitted and being conducted prior to the change in zoning;  provided, that there is a reasonable amount of space for such expansion on the property owned by such industry or business situated within the area which is affected by the change in zoning, so as to avoid nuisances to adjoining landowners.  No building permit or like permission for construction or landscaping shall be denied to an industry or business seeking to expand and continue activities conducted by that industry or business which were permitted prior to the change in zoning;  provided, that there is a reasonable amount of space for such expansion on the property owned by such industry or business situated within the area which is affected by the change in zoning, so as to avoid nuisances to adjoining landowners.

      (C) If any such new facilities do not exceed the original height, density, setback, or square-footage of the original facilities in existence immediately prior to the damage, then the new facilities shall constitute a continuation of the use of the land immediately prior to the damage, and any protections provided hereunder shall not be forfeited.
    
    
      (D) Whenever any ordinance enacted under authority of this chapter establishes stricter terms regarding the amount of partial damage that may be allowed without forfeiture of these protections, then the provisions of any such ordinance shall govern.

    (7) Any operation, rebuilding, or expansion of an off-site sign that has been in existence for ten (10) years or more shall not be denied solely on the basis that the original permit for the sign does not exist to prove that it was a lawful use when constructed.
  

  (i) Notwithstanding subsection (d), any structure rebuilt on the site must conform to the provisions of the existing zoning regulations as to setbacks, height, bulk, or requirements as to the physical location of a structure upon the site, provided that this subsection (i) shall not apply to off-site signs.

  (b) Revenue from tipping fees at publicly owned solid waste disposal facilities and incinerators received by counties, municipalities and solid waste authorities shall be expended only for solid waste management purposes.

  (c) When a municipal solid waste disposal facility is operated as a joint venture by more than one (1) city or county, or combination thereof, or by an authority, the tipping fee authorized under this section shall be imposed by the joint operators or authority, and the tipping fee received shall be remitted to the participating local governments or authorities for expenditure for solid waste management purposes only.

  (h) Any person who intentionally, knowingly or willfully fails to appear in court on the date and time specified on the citation commits a separate misdemeanor offense, regardless of the disposition of the charge for which the person was originally arrested, and upon conviction shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail or workhouse for not more than six (6) months, or by a fine of not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250) or, in the discretion of the court, by both imprisonment and fine.  Proof that the defendant failed to appear when required constitutes prima facie evidence that the failure to appear is willful.

     to the contrary.

  (m) No sheriff may issue a release citation as authorized in this section after the issuance of a mittimus.

    (2) It is the duty of the coordinating committee to develop a recommended growth plan not later than January 1, 2000, and to submit such plan for ratification by the county legislative body and the governing body of each municipality.  The recommended growth plan shall identify urban growth boundaries for each municipality within the county and shall identify planned growth areas and rural areas within the county, all in conformance with 
§ 6-58-106
      .  In developing a recommended growth plan, the coordinating committee shall give due consideration to such urban growth boundaries as may be timely proposed and submitted to the coordinating committee by each municipal governing body.  The coordinating committee shall also give due consideration to such planned growth areas and rural areas as may be timely proposed and submitted to the coordinating committee by the county legislative body.  The coordinating committee is encouraged to utilize planning resources that are available within the county, including municipal or county planning commissions.  The coordinating committee is further encouraged to utilize the services of the county technical assistance service, and the municipal technical advisory service.
  
  
    (3) Prior to finalization of the recommended growth plan, the coordinating committee shall conduct at least two (2) public hearings.  The county shall give at least fifteen (15) days advance notice of the time, place and purpose of each public hearing by notice published in a newspaper of general circulation throughout the county.

    (5) If the county or any municipality therein rejects the recommendation of the coordinating committee, then the county or municipality shall submit its objections, and the reasons therefor, for resolution in accordance with subsection (b).  In resolving disputes arising from disagreements over which urban growth boundary should contain specific territory, due consideration shall be given if one of the municipalities is better able to efficiently and effectively provide urban services within the disputed territory.  Due consideration shall also be given if one of the municipalities detrimentally relied upon priority status conferred under prior annexation law and, thereby, justifiably incurred significant expense in preparation for annexation of the disputed territory.
  
  
    
      (6)(A) A municipality may make binding agreements with other municipalities and with counties to refrain from exercising any power or privilege granted to the municipality by this title, to any degree contained in the agreement including, but not limited to, the authority to annex.

      (B) In any county with a charter form of government, the annexation reserve agreements in effect on January 1, 1998, are deemed to satisfy the requirement of a growth plan.  The county shall file a plan based on such agreements with the committee.
    
  
  
    (8) No provision of this chapter shall prohibit written contracts between municipalities and property owners relative to the exercise of a municipality's rights of annexation or operate to invalidate an annexation ordinance done pursuant to a written contract between a municipality and a property owner in existence on May 19, 1998.
  
  
    
      (9)(A) Instead of the coordinating committee created under subdivision (a)(1), in any county in which the largest municipality comprises at least sixty percent (60%) of the population of the entire county and on May 19, 1998, there is no other municipality in the county with a population in excess of one thousand (1,000), according to the 1990 federal census or any subsequent federal census, the coordinating committee in such county shall be the municipal planning commission of the largest municipality and the county planning commission, if the county has a planning commission.  The mayor of the largest municipality and the county mayor of such county may jointly appoint as many additional members to the coordinating committee as they may determine.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (a) with respect to the adoption or ratification of the recommended growth plan, in any county to which this subdivision (a)(9)(A) applies, upon adoption of a recommended growth plan, the coordinating committee shall submit its recommendation to the county legislative body for ratification.  The county legislative body may only disapprove the recommendation of the coordinating committee if it makes an affirmative finding, by a two-thirds ( 2/3 ) vote, that the committee acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner or abused its official discretion in applying the law.  If the county legislative body disapproves the recommendation of the coordinating committee, then the dispute resolution process of this section shall apply.
    
    
      (B) Instead of the coordinating committee created pursuant to subdivision (a)(1), if the county legislative body and the governing body of each municipality located therein all agree that another entity shall perform the duties assigned by this chapter to the coordinating committee, then such other entity shall perform such duties of the coordinating committee, and such coordinating committee shall not be created or continued, as the case may be.
    
  

  
    (b)(1) If the county or any municipality rejects the recommended growth plan, then the coordinating committee shall reconsider its action.  After such reconsideration, the coordinating committee may recommend a revised growth plan and may submit such revised growth plan for ratification by the county legislative body and the governing body of each municipality.  If a recommended growth plan or revised growth plan is rejected, then the county or any municipality may declare the existence of an impasse and may request the secretary of state to provide an alternative method for resolution of disputes preventing ratification of a growth plan.
  
  
    (2) Upon receiving such request, the secretary of state shall promptly appoint a dispute resolution panel consisting of a minimum of one (1) member and a maximum of three (3) members.  The secretary of state shall have the discretion to determine the size of the panel.  Each member of the panel shall be appointed from the ranks of the administrative law judges employed within the administrative procedures division.  Each member shall possess formal training in the methods and techniques of dispute resolution and mediation.  Panel members and their spouses and immediate family shall not be residents, property owners, officials or employees of the county or any municipality within the county.
  
  
    (3) The panel shall attempt to mediate the unresolved disputes.  If, after reasonable efforts, mediation does not resolve the disputes, then the panel shall propose a non-binding resolution.  The county legislative body and the municipal governing bodies shall be given a reasonable period in which to consider the proposed resolution.  If the county legislative body and the municipal governing bodies do not accept and approve the resolution, the secretary of state shall appoint a new panel of administrative law judges, composed and selected in the same manner specified in subdivision (b)(2), for the purpose of adopting a growth plan.  The panel may initiate formal proceedings, if they are necessary to obtain sufficient information for adopting a growth plan.  These proceedings shall be conducted subject to the open meetings provisions of title 8, chapter 44, but need not be in compliance with the Uniform Administrative Procedures Act, compiled in title 4, chapter 5.  The panel may consult with experts in urban planning, growth and development, and may commission or contract for additional studies and reports on population growth and projections, land utilization and needs, environmental impacts, and the development and production of maps adequate for the use of the panel in mediating a dispute or in adopting a growth plan.  The costs associated with obtaining the services of experts, the production of studies, reports, maps and other documents shall be a reasonable and necessary cost associated with the panel's development of the growth plan.
  
  
    (4) The secretary of state shall certify the reasonable and necessary costs incurred by the dispute resolution panel, including, but not necessarily limited to, salaries, supplies, travel expenses and staff support for the panel members.  The county and the municipalities shall reimburse the secretary of state for such costs, to be allocated on a pro rata basis calculated on the number of persons residing within each of the municipalities and the number of persons residing within the unincorporated areas of the county;  provided, that if the dispute resolution panel determines that the dispute resolution process was necessitated or unduly prolonged by bad faith or frivolous actions on the part of the county and/or any one (1) or more of the municipalities, then the secretary of state may, upon the recommendation of the panel, reallocate liability for such reimbursement in a manner clearly punitive to such bad faith or frivolous actions.
  
  
    (5) If a county or municipality fails to reimburse its allocated or reallocated share of panel costs to the secretary of state after sixty (60) days notice of such costs, the department of finance and administration shall deduct such costs from such county's or a municipality's allocation of state shared taxes.
  

  
    
      (c)(1)(A) No later than July 1, 2001, the growth plan recommended or revised by the coordinating committee and ratified by the county and each municipality therein or alternatively adopted by a dispute resolution panel shall be submitted to and approved by the local government planning advisory committee.
    
    
      (B) IF urban growth boundaries, planned growth areas and rural areas were recommended or revised by a coordinating committee and ratified by the county and each municipality therein;
      THEN the local government planning advisory committee shall grant its approval, and the growth plan shall become immediately effective.
    
    
      (C) In addition, in any county with a charter form of government, the annexation reserve agreements in effect on January 1, 1998, are deemed to satisfy the requirement of a growth plan, and the local government planning advisory committee shall approve such plan.
    
    
      (D) In all other cases:
      IF the local government planning advisory committee determines that such urban growth boundaries, planned growth areas and rural areas conform with the provisions of 
  § 6-58-106
;
      THEN the local government planning advisory committee shall grant its approval and the growth plan shall immediately become effective;
      HOWEVER, IF the local government planning advisory committee determines that such urban growth boundaries, planned growth areas and/or rural areas in any way do not conform with the provisions of 
  § 6-58-106
;
      THEN the committee shall adopt and grant its approval of alternative urban growth boundaries, planned growth areas and/or rural areas for the sole purpose of making the adjustments necessary to achieve conformance with the provisions of 
  § 6-58-106
.
    
    
      (E) Such alternative urban growth boundaries, planned growth areas and/or rural areas shall supersede and replace all conflicting urban growth boundaries, planned growth areas and/or rural areas and shall immediately become effective as the growth plan.
    
  
  
    (2) After the local government planning advisory committee has approved a growth plan, the committee shall forward a copy to the county mayor who shall file the plan in the register's office.  The register may not impose a fee on the county mayor for this service.
  

  
    (d)(1) After the local government planning advisory committee has approved the county's initial growth plan, the plan shall stay in effect for not less than three (3) years absent a showing of extraordinary circumstances.  After the initial three-year period, a growth plan may be amended as often as deemed necessary by the county and cities.  Any time after the expiration of the initial three- year period, the mayor of any municipality in the county or the county mayor or county executive may propose an amendment to the growth plan by filing notice with the county mayor or county executive and with the mayor of each municipality in the county.  Upon receipt of such notice, the county mayor or county executive shall take appropriate action to reconvene or reestablish the coordinating committee within sixty (60) days of the receipt of the notice.  Except as provided for in this subdivision (d)(1), the procedures for amending the growth plan shall be the same as the procedures in this section for establishing the original plan.  The burden of proving the reasonableness and necessity of the proposed amendment shall be upon the party proposing the change.  It is the duty of the coordinating committee to submit the proposed amendment with its recommendation either for or against the amendment to the county legislative body and to the governing body of each municipality within the county for their approval or disapproval within six (6) months of the date of the coordinating committee's first meeting on the proposed amendment.  After the proposed amendment is approved by the county legislative body and the governing body of each municipality and by the local government planning advisory committee, the amendment shall become part of the county's growth plan.
  
  
    (2) In any county with a charter form of government with annexation reserve agreements in effect on January 1, 1998, any municipality or the county may immediately file a proposed amendment after May 19, 1998, in accordance with this subsection (d)."

Education § 49-2-1202,"(a) Any plan of consolidation shall provide for a consolidated board of education, sometimes called “the board” in this part, to be composed of five (5), seven (7) or nine (9) members whose terms of office shall be either four (4) years or six (6) years, as the plan may determine.

  (b) ALTERNATIVE 1.
  
    (1) The plan may provide that the members of the board shall be elected at the general election in August and as determined by the plan, in one (1) of three (3) following modes:
    
      (A) The plan may provide for the election by popular vote of five (5) or seven (7) board members who shall be bona fide residents of the county, without further restriction as to place of residence;
    
    
      (B) The plan may provide for the election of five (5) or seven (7) board members representing five (5) or seven (7) school districts of approximately equal population, each district board member to be voted upon and elected by the voters in the particular school district of which the board member is a bona fide resident;  or
    
    
      (C) The plan may provide for the election of five (5) or seven (7) board members by popular vote of the entire electorate of the county, but with the requirement that all five (5) or seven (7) members shall be bona fide residents of different school districts, in which event that person shall be elected who receives more votes county wide than any other person residing in the same district.
    
  
  
    (2) In the event the plan adopts the option provided for in subdivision (b)(1)(B) or (b)(1)(C), the plan shall create five (5) or seven (7) school districts of approximately equal population and shall prescribe the boundaries of the school districts.  The plan shall also provide appropriate plans for reapportionment of districts after each federal decennial census, so that members of the board may continue to be elected by or from districts of approximately equal population.
  
  
    (3) Terms of office of members of the board shall be staggered.
    
      (A) To bring about such staggered terms, there shall be elected five (5) or seven (7) members of the board at the first general election held subsequent to the adoption of the plan.
    
    
      (B) If the plan provides for full terms of six (6) years, then of the seven (7) members originally elected, those three (3) who receive the higher number of votes shall serve for terms of six (6) years, those two (2) who receive the next higher number of votes shall serve for terms of four (4) years, and the remaining members shall serve for terms of two (2) years.
    
    
      (C) If the plan provides for five (5) members and full terms of six (6) years, then of the five (5) members originally elected, those two (2) who receive the higher number of votes shall serve for terms of six (6) years.  Those two (2) who receive the next higher number of votes shall serve for terms of four (4) years, and the remaining member shall serve for a term of two (2) years.
    
    
      (D) If the plan provides for full terms of four (4) years, then of the seven (7) members originally elected, those four (4) who receive the higher number of votes shall serve for terms of four (4) years and the remaining members shall serve for terms of two (2) years.
    
    
      (E) If the plan provides for five (5) members and full terms of four (4) years, then of the five (5) members originally elected, those three (3) who receive the higher number of votes shall serve for a term of four (4) years and the remaining members shall serve for terms of two (2) years.
    
    
      (F) In the event of a tie vote, the board shall designate the respective terms of those receiving the same number of votes.
    
    
      (G) Subsequent to the first election, members of the board shall be elected for the full term provided in the plan.
    
  
  
    (4) All vacancies on the board shall be filled for the unexpired term at the next regular general election occurring more than thirty (30) days subsequent to the vacancy.
    
      (A) Immediately after the vacancy occurs, the remaining members of the board shall fill the vacancy on an interim basis by the selection of a person qualified under this part to fill the vacancy on a permanent basis.
    
    
      (B) The interim member shall hold office until the vacancy is permanently filled at the next general election.
    
  

  (c) ALTERNATIVE 2.
  
    (1) As another alternative, the plan may provide for the election of five (5) or seven (7) board members representing five (5) or seven (7) school districts of approximately equal population, to be chosen in the following manner:
    
      (A) Where one (1) or more school districts are wholly within the corporate limits of a municipality, members of the consolidated board of education from such districts shall be selected by the governing body of the municipality;
    
    
      (B) Where one (1) or more school districts are wholly outside of the corporate limits of a municipality, the members of the board representing such districts shall be selected by the governing body of the county;
    
    
      (C) Where one (1) or more school districts are partly within and partly outside of the corporate limits of a municipality, the board members representing such districts shall be selected by the governing body of the municipality or by the governing body of the county, depending upon whether a majority of the population of the school district resides within the municipality or without the municipality.
    
  
  
    (2) Terms of board members under this alternative shall be so staggered as the plan may determine.
  
  
    (3) All vacancies on the board under this alternative shall be filled for the unexpired term by the appointing authority with respect to the members of the board from such district.
  

  (d) ALTERNATIVE 3.
  
    (1) As a third alternative, the plan may provide for the election of five (5), seven (7) or nine (9) board members by popular vote at the August general election, with the requirements that at least a majority of the number of board members be bona fide residents of particular districts and elected from such districts, and the remaining number of members being bona fide residents of the county and elected from the county at-large.
  
  
    (2) The plan may further provide that a certain number of districts be completely within the largest municipality in the county and certain districts completely within the county outside of such largest municipality, and a certain number of districts be coincident with the boundaries of the entire county, including the largest municipality.
  
  
    (3) Electors within the city may be permitted to vote for candidates from all districts within the city and for candidates at-large.
  
  
    (4) Electors outside of the city may be permitted to vote for candidates from all districts outside the city and for candidates at-large.
  
  
    (5) The plan shall provide that no more than one (1) member from the county at-large shall be a resident of the same geographical district.
  
  
    (6) The districts provided by the plan shall be of approximately equal population and the boundaries of the districts shall be described in the plan.
  
  
    (7) The plan shall also provide appropriate procedures for the reapportionment of districts after each federal decennial census, so that members of the board may continue to be elected by or from districts of approximately equal population.
  
  
    (8) Terms of board members shall be staggered.
  

  (e) Every consolidated board of education shall have all powers and duties conferred by general law upon county boards of education or city boards of education.  The board is also authorized to do all things necessary or proper for the establishment, operation and maintenance of an efficient and accredited consolidated school system, not inconsistent with this part or other general law."
