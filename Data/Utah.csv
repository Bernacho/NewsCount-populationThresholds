(3) The governing body of the consolidated government shall be a council composed of not less than five persons elected as specified in the plan.  In addition to other powers vested in the consolidated government by law or pursuant to this act,  1 the county council shall have all the legislative and policymaking powers which it is possible for the governing body of a county or a city to possess and which are not expressly denied by the constitution, by general law applicable to all cities or all counties, or by a specific restriction in the plan itself.


(4) Except as provided in this act, the qualifications, mode of election, term of office, method of removal, procedure to fill vacancies, compensation, or other appropriate provisions relating to membership on the county council shall be provided in the plan.


(5) Upon the effective date of the plan, as provided in it, all properties and assets, whether tangible or intangible, and all obligations, debts, and liabilities of those governmental entities which are merged into the consolidated government shall become vested and transferred by operation of law in and to the consolidated government.  The properties, assets, obligations, debts, and liabilities of any city or town not merged into the consolidated government, so far as allocated, used, or incurred primarily to discharge a function which under the plan will no longer be a responsibility of the city or town, shall likewise be vested in and transferred to the consolidated government.  All transfers under this Subsection (5) shall be subject to equitable adjustments, conditions, and limitations provided in the plan and determined by procedures specified in the plan, but the contractual rights of any bondholder or creditor may not be impaired.


(6) Upon the effective date of the plan, and as provided in it, nonelective officers and employees of the governmental entities which are merged into the consolidated government and such officers and employees of nonmerged cities or towns whose qualifications and duties relate primarily to functions which under the plan will no longer be a responsibility of those cities or towns shall be blanketed in and transferred to the consolidated government as officers and employees of it.  Standards and procedures relating to such personnel transfers and for resolving disputes or grievances relating to them shall be provided in the plan.

(1) The structural form of county government known as the “community council” form unites in a single consolidated city and county government the powers, duties, and functions which, immediately prior to its effective date, are vested in the county, the largest city in the county, such other cities and towns as elect to merge in it, and all special taxing districts, public authorities, service areas, and other local public entities functioning within the boundaries of the county, except school districts.  The consolidated government shall have power to extend on a countywide basis any governmental service or function which is authorized by law or which the previous county, cities, and other local public agencies included therein were empowered to provide for their residents, but no such service shall be provided within an incorporated municipality which continues to provide that service for its own inhabitants, except upon a contract basis for the municipality, and no taxes, assessments, fees, or other charges shall be extended or collected within the municipality for the purpose of financing any service which is not provided by the consolidated government within the municipality.  “Largest city,” as used in this section, means a city or cities the population of which, as shown by the most recent decennial or special census, exceeds 35% of the total county population.


(2) The incorporated cities and towns, other than the largest city, in the county shall retain independent corporate existence and shall continue to provide local services to their inhabitants of the type and to the extent provided in the plan, but any such city or town, by majority vote of its qualified voters, cast either concurrently with the election at which the plan is approved or subsequently to it, as provided by the governing body of the city or town, may cause the city or town to be dissolved and its powers, duties, and functions vested in the countywide government.


(3) The county legislative body of the countywide government shall be a council composed of not less than five persons as specified in the plan, elected respectively from communities, which collectively include all of the territory within the county, having boundaries described in the plan embracing substantially equal populations.  In addition to other powers vested in the countywide government by law or pursuant to this act  1, the county council shall have all of the legislative and policymaking powers which it is possible for the governing body of a county or a city to possess and which are not expressly denied by the constitution, by a general law applicable to all cities or all counties, or by a specific restriction in the plan itself.


(4) The voters of each community shall elect a community council composed of the community's elected member of the county council, who shall be chairman of the community council, and not less than two nor more than four additional members elected either from districts of substantially equal population within the community, or at large therein, as may be provided in the plan.  A community council shall have the power and duty, in conformity with guidelines prescribed by the county council, to adopt policies and formulate specific programs relating to and defining the kinds and levels of local governmental services necessary to satisfy the needs and desires of the citizens within the community, but a community council shall have no power to engage personnel or to acquire facilities, property, or equipment for the administration or performance of such services.  Authorized programs for local governmental services which have been approved by a community council shall be submitted to the county council for implementation and shall be carried into effect by the county council and county executive unless, by a vote of not less than 3/4 of its entire membership, the county council determines that a particular program, in whole or in part, should be rejected as contrary to the general welfare of the county.  A community council program for local governmental services within a community:

(a) shall include a method or methods for financing such services;


(b) may provide for supplying of such services by contract or by joint or cooperative action pursuant to Title 11, Chapter 13, Interlocal Cooperation Act, in which case the community council shall be considered a “public agency” within the meaning of said act;  and


(c) may provide for supplying of such services through the creation of service areas pursuant to Title 17B, Chapter 2a, Part 9, Service Area Act.

(b) may provide for supplying of such services by contract or by joint or cooperative action pursuant to Title 11, Chapter 13, Interlocal Cooperation Act, in which case the community council shall be considered a “public agency” within the meaning of said act;  and


(c) may provide for supplying of such services through the creation of service areas pursuant to Title 17B, Chapter 2a, Part 9, Service Area Act.


(5) Notwithstanding Subsection (4), in any community which includes, in whole or in part, the territory of a city or town, no community council program for local government services above the minimum level of area-wide services provided countywide may be submitted to the county council for implementation unless it first is submitted to the governing body of each such city or town for review.  Within 30 days after such submission, the governing body of the city or town:

(a) may file with the community council a written statement of its comments, suggestions, and recommendations relating to the program, and the community council shall give due consideration thereto;  or


(b) may, by resolution or ordinance, provide that any designated part of the community council program relating to a service to be provided within the city or town shall be submitted to the voters thereof at a general or special election to be held therein within 60 days after the date of the resolution or ordinance.  Any part of the program submitted to the voters of a city or town under this Subsection (5) may not be included in the program as submitted to the county council unless it receives an approving vote at such election by majority of all votes cast on the question.

(6) Except as provided herein, the qualifications, mode of election, term of office, method of removal, procedure to fill vacancies, compensation, and other appropriate provisions relating to membership on the county council or community councils shall be provided in the plan.


(7) Upon the effective date of the plan and as provided in it, all properties and assets, whether tangible or intangible, and all obligations, debts, and liabilities, of those governmental entities which are merged into the new countywide government shall become vested and transferred by operation of law in and to the new countywide government.  The properties, assets, obligations, debts, and liabilities of any city or town not merged into the new countywide government, so far as allocated, used, or incurred primarily to discharge a function which under the plan will no longer be a responsibility of the city or town, shall likewise be vested in and transferred to the new countywide government.  All transfers under this Subsection (7) shall be subject to equitable adjustments, conditions, and limitations provided in the plan and determined by procedures specified in the plan, but the contractual rights of any bondholder or creditor may not be impaired.


(8) Upon the effective date of the plan and as provided in it, nonelective officers and employees of governmental entities which are merged into the new countywide government and such officers and employees of nonmerged cities or towns whose qualifications and duties relate primarily to functions which under the plan will no longer be a responsibility of those cities or towns, shall be blanketed in and transferred to the new countywide government as officers and employees of it.  Standards and procedures relating to such personnel transfers, and for resolving disputes or grievances relating thereto, shall be provided in the plan.

(ii) the state opposes the relinquishment or retirement of grazing animal unit months in favor of conservation, wildlife, and other uses;



(iii)(A) the state favors the best management practices that are jointly sponsored by cattlemen's, sportsmen's, and wildlife management groups such as chaining, logging, seeding, burning, and other direct soil and vegetation prescriptions that are demonstrated to restore forest and rangeland health, increase forage, and improve watersheds in grazing districts and allotments for the mutual benefit of domestic livestock and wildlife;


(B) when practices described in Subsection (6)(m)(iii)(A) increase a grazing allotment's forage beyond the total permitted forage use that was allocated to that allotment in the last federal land use plan or allotment management plan still in existence as of January 1, 2005, a reasonable and fair portion of the increase in forage beyond the previously allocated total permitted use should be allocated to wildlife as recommended by a joint, evenly balanced committee of livestock and wildlife representatives that is appointed and constituted by the governor for that purpose;


(C) the state favors quickly and effectively adjusting wildlife population goals and population census numbers in response to variations in the amount of available forage caused by drought or other climatic adjustments, and state agencies responsible for managing wildlife population goals and population census numbers will give due regard to both the needs of the livestock industry and the need to prevent the decline of species to a point where listing under the terms of the Endangered Species Act  1when making such adjustments;



(iv) the state opposes the transfer of grazing animal unit months to wildlife for supposed reasons of rangeland health;


(v) reductions in domestic livestock animal unit months must be temporary and scientifically based upon rangeland conditions;

(vii) any grazing animal unit months that are placed in a suspended use category should be returned to active use when range conditions improve;


(viii) policies, plans, programs, and initiatives related to vegetation management should recognize and uphold the preference for domestic grazing over alternate forage uses in established grazing districts while upholding management practices that optimize and expand forage for grazing and wildlife in conjunction with state wildlife management plans and programs in order to provide maximum available forage for all uses;  and


(ix) in established grazing districts, animal unit months that have been reduced due to rangeland health concerns should be restored to livestock when rangeland conditions improve, and should not be converted to wildlife use.

(a) the state's support for the addition of a river segment to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, 
16 U.S.C. Sec. 1271 et seq.,
 will be withheld until:

(i) it is clearly demonstrated that water is present and flowing at all times;


(ii) it is clearly demonstrated that the required water-related value is considered outstandingly remarkable within a region of comparison consisting of one of the three physiographic provinces in the state, and that the rationale and justification for the conclusions are disclosed;


(iii) it is clearly demonstrated that the inclusion of each river segment is consistent with the plans and policies of the state and the county or counties where the river segment is located as those plans and policies are developed according to Subsection (3);


(iv) the effects of the addition upon the local and state economies, agricultural and industrial operations and interests, outdoor recreation, water rights, water quality, water resource planning, and access to and across river corridors in both upstream and downstream directions from the proposed river segment have been evaluated in detail by the relevant federal agency;


(v) it is clearly demonstrated that the provisions and terms of the process for review of potential additions have been applied in a consistent manner by all federal agencies;


(vi) the rationale and justification for the proposed addition, including a comparison with protections offered by other management tools, is clearly analyzed within the multiple-use mandate, and the results disclosed;


(vii) it is clearly demonstrated that the federal agency with management authority over the river segment, and which is proposing the segment for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic River System will not use the actual or proposed designation as a basis to impose management standards outside of the federal land management plan;


(viii) it is clearly demonstrated that the terms and conditions of the federal land and resource management plan containing a recommendation for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic River System:

(A) evaluates all eligible river segments in the resource planning area completely and fully for suitability for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic River System;


(B) does not suspend or terminate any studies for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic River System at the eligibility phase;


(C) fully disclaims any interest in water rights for the recommended segment as a result of the adoption of the plan;  and


(D) fully disclaims the use of the recommendation for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic River System as a reason or rationale for an evaluation of impacts by proposals for projects upstream, downstream, or within the recommended segment;



(ix) it is clearly demonstrated that the agency with management authority over the river segment commits not to use an actual or proposed designation as a basis to impose Visual Resource Management Class I or II management prescriptions that do not comply with the provisions of Subsection (8)(t);  and


(x) it is clearly demonstrated that including the river segment and the terms and conditions for managing the river segment as part of the National Wild and Scenic River System will not prevent, reduce, impair, or otherwise interfere with:

(A) the state and its citizens' enjoyment of complete and exclusive water rights in and to the rivers of the state as determined by the laws of the state;  or


(B) local, state, regional, or interstate water compacts to which the state or any county is a party;




(b) the conclusions of all studies related to potential additions to the National Wild and Scenic River System, 
16 U.S.C. Sec. 1271 et seq.,
 are submitted to the state for review and action by the Legislature and governor, and the results, in support of or in opposition to, are included in any planning documents or other proposals for addition and are forwarded to the United States Congress;


(c) the state's support for designation of an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), as defined in 
43 U.S.C. Sec. 1702
, within federal land management plans will be withheld until:

(i) it is clearly demonstrated that the proposed area satisfies all the definitional requirements of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 
43 U.S.C. Sec. 1702(a)
;


(ii) it is clearly demonstrated that the area proposed for designation as an ACEC is limited in geographic size and that the proposed management prescriptions are limited in scope to the minimum necessary to specifically protect and prevent irreparable damage to the relevant and important values identified, or limited in geographic size and management prescriptions to the minimum required to specifically protect human life or safety from natural hazards;


(iii) it is clearly demonstrated that the proposed area is limited only to areas that are already developed or used or to areas where no development is required;


(iv) it is clearly demonstrated that the proposed area contains relevant and important historic, cultural or scenic values, fish or wildlife resources, or natural processes which are unique or substantially significant on a regional basis, or contain natural hazards which significantly threaten human life or safety;


(v) the federal agency has analyzed regional values, resources, processes, or hazards for irreparable damage and its potential causes resulting from potential actions which are consistent with the multiple-use, sustained-yield principles, and the analysis describes the rationale for any special management attention required to protect, or prevent irreparable damage to the values, resources, processes, or hazards;


(vi) it is clearly demonstrated that the proposed designation is consistent with the plans and policies of the state and of the county where the proposed designation is located as those plans and policies are developed according to Subsection (3);


(vii) it is clearly demonstrated that the proposed ACEC designation will not be applied redundantly over existing protections provided by other state and federal laws for federal lands or resources on federal lands, and that the federal statutory requirement for special management attention for a proposed ACEC will discuss and justify any management requirements needed in addition to those specified by the other state and federal laws;


(viii) the difference between special management attention required for an ACEC and normal multiple-use management has been identified and justified, and that any determination of irreparable damage has been analyzed and justified for short and long-term horizons;


(ix) it is clearly demonstrated that the proposed designation:

(A) is not a substitute for a wilderness suitability recommendation;


(B) is not a substitute for managing areas inventoried for wilderness characteristics after 1993 under the BLM interim management plan for valid wilderness study areas;  and


(C) it is not an excuse or justification to apply de facto wilderness management standards;  and



(x) the conclusions of all studies are submitted to the state, as a cooperating agency, for review, and the results, in support of or in opposition to, are included in all planning documents;



(d) sufficient federal lands are made available for government-to-government exchanges of school and institutional trust lands and federal lands without regard for a resource-to-resource correspondence between the surface or mineral characteristics of the offered trust lands and the offered federal lands;

(3) “Communicable disease” means illness due to a specific infectious agent or its toxic products which arises through transmission of that agent or its products from a reservoir to a susceptible host, either directly, as from an infected individual or animal, or indirectly, through an intermediate plant or animal host, vector, or the inanimate environment.


(4) “Communicable period” means the time or times during which an infectious agent may be transferred directly or indirectly from an infected individual to another individual, from an infected animal to man, or from an infected man to an animal, including arthropods.


(5) “Contact” means an individual or animal having had association with an infected individual, animal, or contaminated environment so as to have had an opportunity to acquire the infection.

(1) The states party to this compact, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession.  It is the purpose of this compact to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the states party to it, and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.


(2) The party states find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations.  Variations from state to state in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other states.  As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems.  Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their states of origin, can increase the available educational resources.  Participation in this compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.

(2) The urban county is empowered to enter into contractual arrangements for the joint exercise of powers or for performance of services and, for that purpose, may employ and be subject to the provisions of Title 11, Chapter 13, Interlocal Cooperation Act.  By contract, the urban county may perform for any city, town, special taxing district, public authority, service area, or other local public entity within the county any governmental service or function which such entity is lawfully empowered to perform for itself within its own territory, or which the county is lawfully empowered to perform anywhere within the county boundaries.  No contract service or function shall be performed by the county except for a consideration which is at least substantially equal to the cost of performing it.


(3) The plan for an urban county form of county government may provide for organization of the unincorporated territory of the county into one or more service areas and, for this purpose, may provide for special organizing or implementing procedures which differ from those provided in Title 17B, Chapter 2a, Part 9, Service Area Act.  Except to the extent that the plan provides to the contrary, all noncontract services and functions lawfully performed by the county solely within unincorporated territory and not on a countywide basis shall, after the effective date of the plan, be considered performed and extended solely as services of, and financed by and through, the county service area.  The plan may provide for, limit, or condition the services and functions which the urban county is authorized to perform and extend within the territory of incorporated cities and towns within the county and may provide procedures by which such provisions, limits, or conditions may be established and changed from time to time.


(4) The plan for the urban county shall provide for the election of a county council, composed of not less than three members.  The council shall be the county legislative body and shall exercise all legislative powers authorized by law.  The plan shall specify:

(a) whether the members of the council are to be elected from districts, at large, or by a combination of district and at-large constituencies;


(b) their qualifications and terms of office, and whether such terms are concurrent or overlapping;


(c) grounds for and methods for removal of council members from office;


(d) procedures for filling vacancies on the council, provided that the procedures shall conform with 
Section 20A-1-508

(b) the potential for abundant natural and vegetative resources exists within these zones if managed properly, that will support and expand continued, responsible agricultural livestock activities and wildlife habitat;


(c) agricultural livestock activities in these zones and the associated historic resources, human history, shaping of human endeavors, variety of cultural resources, landmarks, structures, and other objects of historic or scientific interest are worthy of recognition, preservation, and protection;



(d)(i) the highest management priority for lands within these zones is the preservation, restoration, and enhancement of watershed and rangeland health to sustain and expand forage production for both livestock grazing and wildlife habitat, and the restoration and development of historic, existing, and future livestock grazing and wildlife habitat resources in order to provide protection for the resources, objects, customs, culture, and values identified above;  and


(ii) notwithstanding Subsection (4)(d)(i), if part or all of any zone lies within a sage grouse management area, then the management priorities for such part shall be consistent with the management priorities set forth in Subsection (4)(d)(i) to the maximum extent consistent with the management priorities of the sage grouse management area;



(e) subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), responsible development of any deposits of energy and mineral resources, including oil, natural gas, oil shale, oil sands, coal, phosphate, gold, uranium, and copper, as well as areas with wind and solar energy potential, that may exist in these zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection (4)(d)(i) in these zones;  and


(f) subject to Subsection (4)(d)(ii), responsible development of any recreation resources, including roads, campgrounds, water resources, trails, OHV use, sightseeing, canyoneering, hunting, fishing, trapping, and hiking resources that may exist in these grazing zones is compatible with the management priorities of Subsection (4)(d)(i) in these grazing zones.

(5) The state finds with respect to the zones described in Subsection (2) that the historic levels of livestock grazing activity and other values identified in Subsection (4) in each zone have greatly diminished, or are under other serious threat, due to:

(a) unreasonable, arbitrary, and unlawfully restrictive federal management policies, including:

(i) de facto managing for wilderness in nonwilderness areas and non-WSAs;


(ii) ignoring the chiefly valuable for grazing designation of the Secretary of the Interior applicable to each of these zones;  and


(iii) the arbitrary administrative reductions in animal unit months of permitted forage;



(b) inflexible federal grazing practices that disallow grazing at different times each year proven to be most effective for maintaining and enhancing rangeland conditions;


(c) mismanagement of wild horses and burros resulting in competition for forage by excess and mismanaged populations of wild horses and burros in Beaver and Emery counties;


(d) improper management of vegetation resulting in the overgrowth of pinion, invasive species, and juniper, and other woody vegetation that:

(i) compromise watershed and rangeland health;


(ii) crowd out grazing forage;


(iii) degrade habitat and limit wildlife populations;


(iv) reduce water yield;  and


(v) heighten the risk of catastrophic wildfire;  and



(e) other practices that degrade overall rangeland health.

ARTICLE VII--APPORTIONMENT OF WATER AND RELATED MATTERS


A. So far as the states are concerned, all waters of the Columbia River System shall be available for appropriation for beneficial purposes under and to the extent permitted by the laws of the states involved, but, except for the provisions in this subdivision A relating to certain relationships between consumptive and nonconsumptive uses, no apportionment of waters or determination of rights to the use thereof is made by this compact.

Utah Code Title 77. Utah Code of Criminal Procedure § 77-28c-103. Compact,https://codes.findlaw.com/ut/title-77-utah-code-of-criminal-procedure/ut-code-sect-77-28c-103.html,"
ARTICLE I
PURPOSE

(a) The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the by-laws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary, return offenders to the originating jurisdictions.  The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 
4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965)
, has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.


(b) It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states:  To provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community;  to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states;  and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.


(c) In addition, this compact will:  Create an Interstate Commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections, or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact;  ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;  establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches, and criminal justice administrators;  monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;  and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.


(d) The compacting states recognize that there is no “right” of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and by-laws and rules promulgated hereunder.  It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.
