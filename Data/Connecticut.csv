(a) Any municipality that was a distressed municipality under the provisions of subsection (b) of 
section 32-9p
 on February 1, 1986, may, with the approval of the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development, designate an area of such municipality as an enterprise zone.  Any such area shall consist of one or two contiguous United States census tracts, contiguous portions of such census tracts or a portion of an individual census tract, as determined in accordance with the most recent United States census and, if such area is covered by zoning, a portion of it shall be zoned to allow commercial or industrial activity.  The census tracts within which such designated area is located shall also meet at least one of the following criteria:  (1) Twenty-five per cent or more of the persons within the individual census tracts shall have income below the poverty level, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution;  (2) twenty-five per cent or more of the families within the individual census tracts shall receive public assistance or welfare income, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution;  or (3) the unemployment rate of the individual census tracts shall be at least two hundred per cent of the state's average, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution.  In calculating any such percentage for one or two contiguous census tracts, contiguous portions of census tracts or a portion of an individual census tract, the commissioner shall round up to the nearest whole percentage number.  If a census tract qualifies under the eligibility criteria for designation as an enterprise zone and if the commissioner determines that a census tract which is contiguous to such tract has significant job creation potential, the commissioner may include such contiguous census tract, or a portion thereof, in the enterprise zone in lieu of a second qualified census tract if such contiguous census tract meets at least one of the following reduced criteria:  (A) Fifteen per cent or more of the persons within the census tract shall have income below the poverty level, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution;  (B) fifteen per cent or more of the families within the census tract shall receive public assistance or welfare income, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution;  or (C) the unemployment rate of the census tract shall be at least one hundred fifty per cent of the state's average, as determined by the most recent United States census, as officially updated by the appropriate state agency or institution.  If a census tract boundary line is the center line of a street, the commissioner may include within the enterprise zone that portion of the property fronting on such street which is outside of but adjacent to the census tract.  The depth of such property so included in the enterprise zone shall be determined by the commissioner at the time of the designation of the zone.  If a census tract boundary line is located along a railroad right-of-way, railroad property or natural stream of water, the commissioner may include within the enterprise zone any private properties under common ownership which are traversed by the railroad right-of-way, railroad property or natural stream of water.  Any private properties so affected shall be included in the enterprise zone at the time of the designation of the zone except, in the case of an enterprise zone designated prior to October 1, 1983, the commissioner may include within the zone any such property if the municipality in which the zone is located requests the commissioner to include such property not later than sixty days after October 1, 1983.  If more than twenty-five per cent of the project area of a development project under chapter 132   1 is located in an area eligible for designation as an enterprise zone and the project plan for such development project is approved by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development in accordance with 
section 8-191
, the commissioner may include the entire project area of such development project area in an enterprise zone.  If more than twenty-five per cent of the project area of a municipal development project under chapter 588l   2 is located in an area eligible for designation as an enterprise zone and the development plan for such project is approved by the Commissioner of Economic and Community Development in accordance with 
section 32-224
, the commissioner may include the entire project area of such project in an enterprise zone.  If more than fifty per cent of an approved redevelopment area under chapter 130   3 is located in an area eligible for designation as an enterprise zone, the commissioner may include the entire redevelopment area in an enterprise zone.  The commissioner may also include in the area designated as an enterprise zone (i) any facility, as defined in 
section 32-9p
, which is located outside of but contiguous to a census tract included in the zone, (ii) any private properties which are (I) under common ownership, (II) located outside of a census tract included in the zone and (III) contiguous to a railroad right-of-way which is the boundary of such a census tract, or (iii) any private properties which are located outside of a census tract included in the zone, but between the zone and a railroad right-of-way, where other segments of such railroad right-of-way serve as boundaries for the zone.  The commissioner may, at any time after the designation of an area as an enterprise zone, include in such zone any area contiguous to such zone which, at the time of the designation of such zone, was eligible to be included in such zone but was not so included.  The commissioner may, at any time after the designation of an area as an enterprise zone, include in such zone any property which is located within one hundred fifty feet of a stream, the center line of which is the boundary of a census tract included in such zone, and which property contains an existing building or facility, having an area equal to or greater than one hundred thousand square feet, that is or was formerly used for manufacturing purposes but is underutilized or vacant at the time the property is included in such zone.  If the commissioner determines that the necessary data is not available from the most recent United States census, the commissioner may use such data as the commissioner deems appropriate.  The commissioner shall include in the designation of the enterprise zone in the city of Meriden the entire parcel of land bordered by Cook Avenue, Hanover Street, Perkins Street Square, and South Colony Street.


(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, (1) any municipality which has an enterprise zone may with the approval of the commissioner, expand such enterprise zone by designating for inclusion in such zone one or more additional census tracts or contiguous portions of such census tract or tracts, provided such census tract or tracts are located in the municipality, are contiguous to the enterprise zone and meet the reduced criteria for contiguous census tracts in subsection (a) of this section, (2) any municipality which is contiguous to an enterprise zone which is located in another municipality may, with the approval of the commissioner, designate as an enterprise zone one or more census tracts or contiguous portions of such census tract or tracts, which are located in the municipality making such designation, provided such census tract or tracts meet the reduced criteria for contiguous census tracts in subsection (a) of this section and are contiguous to the enterprise zone located in the other municipality.  When approving such an expanded or new zone under this subsection, the commissioner shall consider the development rationale, proposed local effort and job creation potential of such expanded or new zone as demonstrated by the municipality and (3) any municipality which is contiguous to an enterprise zone which is located in another municipality may, with the approval of the commissioner and the legislative body of the municipality containing the enterprise zone, designate as an enterprise zone one or more census tracts or portions of such census tract or tracts that are contiguous to the enterprise zone in the other municipality, provided no municipality which designates an enterprise zone in this manner shall be considered to be a targeted investment community, as defined in 
section 32-222
, or an enterprise zone community.

Sec. 6
. [As amended] a. The assembly and senatorial districts and congressional districts as now established by law shall continue until the regular session of the general assembly next after the completion of the taking of the next census of the United States.  On or before the fifteenth day of February next following the year in which the decennial census of the United States is taken, the general assembly shall appoint a reapportionment committee consisting of four members of the senate, two who shall be designated by the president pro tempore of the senate and two who shall be designated by the minority leader of the senate, and four members of the house of representatives, two who shall be designated by the speaker of the house of representatives and two who shall be designated by the minority leader of the house of representatives, provided there are members of no more than two political parties in either the senate or the house of representatives.  In the event that there are members of more than two political parties in a house of the general assembly, all members of that house belonging to the parties other than that of the president pro tempore of the senate or the speaker of the house of representatives, as the case may be, shall select one of their number, who shall designate two members of the committee in lieu of the designation by the minority leader of that house.  Such committee shall advise the general assembly on matters of apportionment.  Upon the filing of a report of such committee with the clerk of the house of representatives and the clerk of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives and the president pro tempore of the senate shall, if the general assembly is not in regular session, convene the general assembly in special session for the sole purpose of adopting a plan of districting.  Upon the request of the speaker of the house of representatives and the president pro tempore of the senate, the secretary of the state shall give notice of such special session by mailing a true copy of the call of such special session, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to each member of the house of representatives and of the senate at his or her address as it appears upon the records of said secretary not less than ten nor more than fifteen days prior to the date of convening of such special session or by causing a true copy of the call to be delivered to each member by a constable, state policeman or indifferent person at least twenty-four hours prior to the time of convening of such special session.  Such general assembly shall, upon roll call, by a yea vote of at least two-thirds of the membership of each house, adopt such plan of districting as is necessary to preserve a proper apportionment of representation in accordance with the principles recited in this article.  Thereafter the general assembly shall decennially at its next regular session or special session called for the purpose of adopting a plan of districting following the completion of the taking of the census of the United States, upon roll call, by a yea vote of at least two-thirds of the membership of each house, adopt such plan of districting as is necessary in accordance with the provisions of this article.


b. If the general assembly fails to adopt a plan of districting by the fifteenth day of the September next following the year in which the decennial census of the United States is taken, the governor shall forthwith appoint a commission designated by the president pro tempore of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives, the minority leader of the senate and the minority leader of the house of representatives, each of whom shall designate two members of the commission, provided that there are members of no more than two political parties in either the senate or the house of representatives.  In the event that there are members of more than two political parties in a house of the general assembly, all members of that house belonging to the parties other than that of the president pro tempore of the senate or the speaker of the house of representatives, as the case may be, shall select one of their number, who shall designate two members of the commission in lieu of the designation by the minority leader of that house.  The eight members of the commission so designated shall within thirty days select an elector of the state as a ninth member.


c. The commission shall proceed to consider the alteration of districts in accordance with the principles recited in this article and it shall submit a plan of districting to the secretary of the state by the thirtieth day of the November next succeeding the appointment of its members.  No plan shall be submitted to the secretary unless it is certified by at least five members of the commission.  Upon receiving such plan the secretary shall publish the same forthwith, and, upon publication, such plan of districting shall have the full force of law.  If the commission shall fail to submit such a plan by the thirtieth day of November, the secretary of the state shall forthwith so notify the chief justice of the supreme court.


d. Original jurisdiction is vested in the supreme court to be exercised on the petition of any registered voter whereby said court may compel the commission, by mandamus or otherwise, to perform its duty or to correct any error made in its plan of districting, or said court may take such other action to effectuate the purposes of this article, including the establishing of a plan of districting if the commission fails to file its plan of districting by the thirtieth day of November as said court may deem appropriate.  Any such petition shall be filed within thirty days of the date specified for any duty or within thirty days after the filing of a plan of districting.  The supreme court shall render its decision not later than forty-five days following the filing of such petition or shall file its plan with the secretary of the state not later than the fifteenth day of February next following the time for submission of a plan of districting by the commission.  Upon receiving such plan the secretary shall publish the same forthwith, and, upon publication, such plan of districting shall have the full force of the law.

(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of a charter or special act, a zoning commission may adopt, as part of the zoning regulations adopted under 
section 8-2
 or any special act, regulations establishing an incentive housing zone in accordance with the provisions of 
sections 8-13m
 to 
8-13x
, inclusive.


(b) An incentive housing zone shall satisfy the following requirements:

(1) The zone shall be consistent with the state plan of conservation and development and be located in an eligible location.


(2) The regulations of the zone shall permit, as of right, incentive housing development.


(3) The minimum allowable density for incentive housing development, per acre of developable land, shall be:  (A) Six units per acre for single-family detached housing;  (B) ten units per acre for duplex or townhouse housing;  and (C) twenty units per acre for multifamily housing, provided that a municipality whose population as determined by the most recent federal decennial census is less than five thousand, when applying to the commissioner for a letter of eligibility under 
section 8-13q
, may request approval of minimum as of right densities of not less than four units per acre for single-family detached housing, not less than six units per acre for duplex or townhouse housing, and not less than ten units per acre for multifamily housing.  In making such request, the municipality shall provide the Commissioner of Housing with evidence of sewage disposal, water supply, traffic safety or other existing, substantial infrastructure limitations that prevent adoption of the minimum densities set forth in this subdivision.  If the proposed incentive housing zone otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section, the commissioner may issue the requested letter of eligibility.  A municipality may request a waiver of the density requirements of this subdivision and the commissioner may grant a waiver if the municipality demonstrates in the application that the land to be zoned for incentive housing development is owned or controlled by the municipality itself, an agency thereof, or a land trust, housing trust fund or a nonprofit housing agency or corporation.  The proposed incentive housing zone regulation shall require, in an enforceable manner, that one hundred per cent of the proposed residential units will be subject to an incentive housing restriction, and the proposed incentive housing zone will otherwise satisfy the requirements of this section.


(4) In order to qualify for financial incentive payments set forth in 
section 8-13s
, the regulations of an incentive housing zone concerning the minimum as of right densities set forth in subdivision (3) of this subsection shall constitute an increase of at least twenty-five per cent above the density allowed by the underlying zone, notwithstanding the provisions of said 
section 8-13s
 with regard to zone adoption and building permit payments.


(5) The minimum densities prescribed in subdivision (3) of this subsection shall be subject only to site plan or subdivision procedures, submission requirements and approval standards of the municipality, and shall not be subject to special permit or special exception procedures, requirements or standards.


(6) An incentive housing zone may consist of one or more subzones, provided each subzone and the zone as a whole comply with the requirements of

(d) If a zoning commission adopts a regulation for an incentive housing zone that permits single-family detached homes on subdivided lots, requiring subdivision approval under the subdivision regulations of the municipality, the zoning commission shall make a written finding that the applicability of such subdivision regulations will not unreasonably impair the economic or physical feasibility of constructing housing at the minimum densities and subject to an incentive housing restriction as required in 
sections 8-13m
 to 
8-13x
, inclusive.  If housing on subdivided lots is proposed in an incentive housing zone, the zoning commission shall use its best efforts to adopt or encourage the planning commission to adopt subdivision standards that will ensure consistency of the single-family detached housing with the purposes of

(f) An incentive housing zone may overlay all or any part of an existing historic district or districts, and a municipality may establish an historic district within an approved incentive housing zone, provided, if the requirements or regulations of such historic district render the approved housing incentive zone not in compliance with the provisions of 
sections 8-13m
 to 
8-13x
, inclusive, the commissioner shall deny a preliminary or final letter of eligibility, deny or revoke a certificate of compliance, or deny any financial incentive payments set forth in 
section 8-13s

(g) An applicant for site plan or subdivision approval to construct an incentive housing development within an approved zone may, through an incentive housing restriction, exceed the minimum requirements for such a development as follows:  (1) More than twenty per cent of the total proposed dwelling units may be subject to the restriction;  (2) the maximum annual income of qualifying households may be less than eighty per cent of the area median income;  or (3) the duration of the restriction may be longer than thirty years.  An application for approval of an incentive housing development may not be denied on the basis that the proposed incentive housing restriction contains one or more of the provisions set forth in this subsection.


(h) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to affect the power of a zoning commission to adopt or amend regulations under chapter 124   1 or any special act.

(b) A cooperative arrangement established pursuant to

(a) For purposes of this section, “specialized long-term care” means goal-oriented, comprehensive, inpatient care designed for a patient with an acute illness, injury or exacerbation of a disease process.  Most patients receiving such care shall not require high-technology monitoring or complex diagnostic procedures.  Such care requires a specifically designed program of coordinated services of an interdisciplinary team, including, but not limited to, physicians, nurses and professionals in other relevant disciplines.


(b) Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes or the regulations of Connecticut state agencies, the Department of Social Services shall establish a demonstration project which shall provide specialized long-term care for chronically disabled and dependent patients with traumatic head, brain or spinal cord injuries, who are ventilator dependent, or suffer severe neurological dysfunction and disorders, including multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy and such other similar chronic medical conditions as the Commissioner of Social Services deems appropriate.


(c) Said demonstration project shall be conducted in no more than three facilities, involving up to seventy-five existing licensed beds, that are specifically equipped and staffed for such purpose.  Said demonstration project shall supplement a facility's scope of services and, if necessary, modify its physical environment to improve access for patients with specific chronic medical conditions, provide care that meets such patient's specialized health, social and environmental needs, particularly those of children and young adults, and evaluate the optimum design for such programs.


(d) Said demonstration project shall establish rates based on costs related to patient care.  Said demonstration project shall be designed for this specific patient population and shall not necessarily require separate facilities or special units.


(e) Said demonstration project shall address the different needs of (1) a child or young adult with specific chronic medical conditions, and (2) an elderly patient in either a hospital or a skilled nursing home.

(b) As herein used in subsection (a) of 
section 10-46
 and 
sections 10-63j
 to 
10-63t

(c) If within three months after the Commissioner of Education has specified the date after which the regional board can act only by weighted vote, a plan of representation has not been established for the regional school district, the State Board of Education shall establish a plan of representation for that regional school district and file it with the town clerk of each participating town.  Said plan shall have the full force of law and shall remain in effect until a plan of representation has been adopted by the towns within the regional school district in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of 
section 10-46
 and 
sections 10-63j

section 22a-241b
 or require that such receptacles comply with provisions for bulk or lot area, or similar provisions, except provisions for side yards, rear yards and front yards.  No such regulations shall unreasonably restrict access to or the size of such receptacles for businesses, given the nature of the business and the volume of items designated for recycling in accordance with

 and prior to the opening of any dog race track by such person or business organization, any other person or business organization licensed to conduct jai alai events is authorized to conduct a number of performances greater than the number authorized for such licensee in the previous calendar year, the commissioner shall pay the municipality in which the jai alai fronton for which such license was surrendered was located, rather than the municipality in which the jai alai fronton conducting the increased performances is located, one-half of one per cent of the total money wagered on jai alai games for such increased performances at the fronton which conducted the additional performances, except the commissioner shall pay each such municipality having a population in excess of fifty thousand one per cent of the total money wagered on jai alai games for such increased performances at such fronton.  (3) During any state fiscal year ending on or after June 30, 1993, the commissioner shall pay each municipality in which a dog race track was operating prior to July 5, 1991, one per cent of the total money wagered on dog racing events at such dog race track.  (4) During the state fiscal year ending June 30, 2001, each municipality in which a dog race track was operating prior to July 5, 1991, shall pay the Northeast Connecticut Economic Alliance, Inc. two-tenths of one per cent of the total money wagered on dog racing events at any dog race track operating prior to July 5, 1991.  (5) In the event a licensee incurs a loss from the operation of a pari-mutuel facility, as determined by the commissioner, the legislative body of the city or town in which such facility is located may direct the commissioner to credit or rebate all or a part of the revenue otherwise due to the municipality back to the facility.  In no case shall such credit and such reimbursement exceed the amount of the licensee's loss, and in no fiscal year shall these provisions affect the total fees paid to the state by the authorized operator of the off-track betting system on its off-track betting activities.

Connecticut General Statutes Title 7. Municipalities § 7-481. Declaration of legislative policy,https://codes.findlaw.com/ct/title-7-municipalities/ct-gen-st-sect-7-481.html,"
(a) It is hereby found and declared that there continues to exist in the state in many of its municipalities conditions of substantial and persistent unemployment;  that many existing residential, industrial, commercial and manufacturing facilities within many municipalities are either obsolete, inefficient or dilapidated or are located without regard to the master plans of such municipalities;  that the obsolescence and abandonment of existing facilities will increase with technological advances, the provision of modern, efficient facilities in other states and the difficulty which many municipalities have in attracting and holding new facilities;  and that many existing and planned industrial, manufacturing and commercial facilities are far from or not easily accessible to the places of residence of substantial numbers of unemployed and underemployed persons.


(b) It is further found and declared that there exists a critical shortage of adequate housing in many municipalities which is the result of declines in new housing starts and the existing large number of substandard, unsafe and unsanitary dwellings;  that a large and significant number of residents of many municipalities have been and will be subject to hardship in finding adequate, safe and sanitary housing unless new facilities are constructed and existing housing, where appropriate, is rehabilitated;  that unless the supply of housing is increased significantly and expeditiously, a large number of such residents will be compelled to live in unsanitary, overcrowded and unsafe conditions to the detriment of the health, welfare and well being of these persons and of such municipalities or such residents will abandon such municipalities to find suitable housing elsewhere, thus further contributing to the decline of such municipalities;  and that by increasing the housing supply in such municipalities and the ability of their residents to obtain decent, safe and sanitary housing, the critical shortage of adequate housing will be ameliorated.


(c) It is further found and declared that such conditions combined with the existence in many municipalities within the state of residential, nonresidential, commercial, industrial, vacant or predominantly vacant areas which are slum or blighted because of substandard, unsanitary, deteriorated or deteriorating conditions which accelerate the decline of population in such municipalities, retard sound economic growth and physical development, erode the financial position of such municipalities and their residents by shrinking their tax base, increasing the share of the tax burden which each taxpayer must bear and reducing the incentive for investment in such municipalities, and adversely affect the health, safety, welfare and prosperity of the state and more particularly the people of such municipalities.


(d) It is further found and declared that, by virtue of their architectural and cultural heritage, their positions as principal centers of communication and transportation and their concentration of productive and energy efficient facilities, many municipalities are capable of ameliorating the conditions of deterioration which impede sound community growth and development;  that building a proper balance of housing, industrial and commercial facilities and increasing the attractiveness of such municipalities to persons of all income levels are essential to restoring such municipalities as desirable places to live, work, shop and enjoy life's amenities;  that the accomplishment of these objectives is beyond remedy solely by the regulatory process in the exercise of the police power and cannot be dealt with effectively by the ordinary operations of private enterprise without the powers provided herein;  and that the exercise of the powers herein provided is critical to continuing the process of revitalizing such municipalities and will serve an urgent public use and purpose.


(e) The necessity in the public interest and for the public benefit and good of the provisions of this chapter is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.

(a) Whenever a district has made an appropriation or incurred a debt, to purchase, acquire, construct, improve or extend any transit facility or transit system or to refund outstanding bonds or notes, it may issue in the name of the transit district general obligation bonds secured by the full faith and credit of the transit district, or revenue bonds secured by a pledge of revenues, or bonds secured by both the full faith and credit of the transit district and a pledge of revenues.  Any such bonds which are secured by the full faith and credit of the transit district or by both the full faith and credit of the transit district and a pledge of revenues shall be in serial form and may mature in annual installments which shall be substantially equal or shall be so arranged that no installments payable in any year shall be less than the amount of any installment payable in any subsequent year, or may mature in annual installments on a maturity schedule that will substantially equalize the payment of principal and interest annually.  The first installment of any series of bonds shall mature not later than two years from the date of the issue of such series and the last installment of such series shall mature not later than forty years therefrom.  Any revenue bonds may mature at term, which shall not exceed forty years from the date of issue, or in such installments prior thereto as the board of directors determines.  The term of any anticipation notes issued pursuant to this chapter shall not be included in computing the time within which such bonds shall mature.  The bonds of each issue may be sold at public or private sale, at or above or below par, may be fully registered, registrable as principal only or in bearer form, and may be made redeemable before maturity at such price or prices, and under such terms and conditions, all as shall be provided by the board of directors.  The board of directors, or such officer as the board shall designate, shall determine the rate of interest which such bonds shall bear, the form of such bonds, the persons by whom such bonds are to be signed, the place or places for payment of principal and interest, and the manner of execution of such bonds.


(b) A public hearing shall be held on any proposed resolution to authorize the issuance of bonds.  Notice of the public hearing and a copy of the proposed resolution shall be published fifteen days before the date of the public hearing in a newspaper or newspapers having a substantial circulation in the district.  All such bonds shall be authorized after such public hearing by resolution adopted by a majority of all the directors of the transit district, provided no resolution authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds exceeding two hundred fifty thousand dollars shall become effective until ninety days after publication of notice of passage of the resolution in a newspaper or newspapers having a substantial circulation in the district.  Such resolution authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds exceeding two hundred fifty thousand dollars shall become effective ninety days after publication of notice of passage of the resolution by the board of directors of the transit district unless the legislative bodies of those constituent municipalities whose population comprises forty per cent of the population of all the constituent municipalities vote to disapprove such resolution within such ninety-day period, or unless the legislative bodies of one-third of the constituent municipalities vote to disapprove such resolution within such ninety-day period.  The effective date of such resolution authorizing the issuance of general obligation bonds exceeding two hundred fifty thousand dollars shall be suspended if petitions requesting a district-wide referendum on such resolution and signed by not less than ten per cent of the electors of any municipality which is a member of the transit district, or by not less than five per cent of the electors of all the municipalities which are members of the transit district, and complying with 
section 7-9
, are filed with the clerk of any such municipalities within the sixty-day period following the publication of notice of passage.  Each clerk with whom a petition is properly and timely filed shall notify the chairman or chief executive officer of the transit district in writing of the total number of electors in that municipality and the total number of such electors whose signatures appear on such a petition.  Where the required number of signatures on such petition have been submitted, the chairman of the district shall designate a day and the hours of voting at such referendum, which referendum shall be held simultaneously in each member municipality, such day to be not more than fifty days after the last day to file such petitions, and not less than twenty days after notice of such referendum and a copy of such resolution are published in a newspaper or newspapers having a substantial circulation in the district.  All electors in each of the municipalities which are members of the transit district shall be entitled to vote at such referendum.  Such resolution shall become effective upon receiving the favorable vote of a majority of all electors voting thereon at such referendum.


(c) “Annual receipts from taxation” means the receipts from taxation of all the municipalities which are members of the transit district for the fiscal year next preceding the date of issue.  Notwithstanding the provisions of 
section 7-374
, any transit district may issue bonds, provided the aggregate indebtedness of such district shall not exceed one times the annual receipts from taxation.  Bonds and notes issued under the provisions of this section for the purposes of this chapter shall not be subject to 
section 7-374
 or to any other statutory limitations on the indebtedness of any municipality which is a member of the transit district and shall not be included in computing the aggregate indebtedness of any municipality which is a member of the transit district.


(d) Whenever a transit district has been authorized to issue bonds as provided by this section, the board of directors of such district may authorize without public hearing the issuance of temporary notes in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds from the sale of such bonds.  Such notes shall be issued for a period of not more than four years, but notes issued for a shorter period of time may be renewed by the issue of other notes provided the period from the date of the original notes to the maturity of the last notes issued in renewal thereof shall not exceed four years, and, to the extent of the unpaid balance of federal and state grants as to which the transit district has a written commitment, notes may be renewed by the issue of other notes for such longer time pending receipt of such grant proceeds.


(e) In the discretion of the board of directors, the revenue bonds of the transit district may be secured by a trust indenture between the transit district and a corporate trustee, which trustee may be any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company in the state.  Such indenture may contain reasonable and adequate provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bond holders and may restrict their individual rights of action as is customary in trust indentures securing bonds and debentures of corporations.


(f) The bonds and notes of a transit district issued pursuant to this chapter shall be lawful investments of the state and all governmental units and agencies thereof, of all banks, trust companies, savings banks, savings and loan associations, investment companies, insurance companies, insurance associations, and of all executors, administrators, guardians, trustees and other fiduciaries.


(g) Bonds and notes issued under the provisions of this chapter, their transfer and the income therefrom, including any profit made on the sale thereof, shall at all times be free from taxation within the state.


(h) If at any time the transit district is in default on the payment of the principal of or interest on general obligation bonds or bond anticipation notes of such transit district, the chief fiscal officer of the defaulting transit district shall set apart from the first revenues thereafter received by the transit district, from whatever source, except revenues pledged as security for other bonds or notes and those federal or state grants or loans which the grant agency restricts to uses other than debt service on the district's bonds or bond anticipation notes, an amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest due and owing on such bonds or bond anticipation notes and shall immediately apply such amount to such default.


(i) If so recommended by the Commissioner of Transportation and if so authorized by resolution of the State Bond Commission, the state shall unconditionally guarantee the punctual payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds or notes of the transit district issued under the provisions of this chapter, provided the aggregate principal amount of such bonds or notes so guaranteed pursuant to this section shall not exceed fifty million dollars.  Any such guarantee of bonds or notes of a transit district made pursuant to this section shall be evidenced by endorsement thereof on such bonds or notes, executed in the name of the state and on its behalf by such officer thereof as may be designated in said resolution of the State Bond Commission authorizing such guarantee.  The execution of such a guarantee on any bonds or notes issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter as aforesaid shall obligate the state to pay the principal of and interest on said bonds or notes upon default in such payment by the transit district.


(j) A district may issue bonds, notes or other obligations under this section, the interest on which may be includable in the gross income of the holder or holders thereof under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,   1 or any subsequent corresponding internal revenue code of the United States, as from time to time amended, or any subsequent such code.  The district may issue such bonds, notes or obligations only upon finding that such issuance is necessary, in the public interest and furthers the purposes and powers of the district.

(c) In determining whether good cause has been established for not entering into a franchise establishing a new dealer or relocating an existing dealer for the same line make, the commissioner shall take into consideration the existing circumstances, including, but not limited to:  (1) The permanency and size of investment made and the reasonable obligations incurred by the existing new motor vehicle dealers in the relevant market area;  (2) growth or decline in population and new car registrations in the relevant market area;  (3) effect on the consuming public in the relevant market area;  (4) whether it is injurious or beneficial to the public welfare for a new dealer to be established;  (5) whether the dealers of the same line make in that relevant market area are providing adequate competition and convenient customer care for the motor vehicles of the line make in the market area including the adequacy of motor vehicle sales and service facilities, equipment, supply of motor vehicle parts, and qualified service personnel;  (6) whether the establishment of a new dealer would increase or decrease competition;  (7) the effect on the relocating dealer of a denial of its relocation into the relevant market area;  (8) whether the establishment or relocation of the proposed dealership appears to be warranted and justified based on economic and marketing conditions pertinent to dealers competing in the community or territory, including anticipated future changes;  (9) the reasonably expected market penetration of the line-maker motor vehicle for the community or territory involved, after consideration of all factors which may affect said penetration, including, but not limited to, demographic factors such as age, income, education, size class preference, product popularity, retail lease transactions, or other factors affecting sales to consumers of the community or territory;  (10) the economic impact of an additional franchise or relocated motor vehicle dealership upon the existing motor vehicle dealers of the same line make in the relevant market area to be served by the additional franchisee or relocated motor vehicle dealership;  and (11) the retail sales and service business transacted by the existing dealers of the same line make in the market area to be served by the proposed new or relocated dealer as compared to the business available to them during the three-year period immediately preceding notice.


(d) The commissioner shall conduct the hearing and render his final determination within one hundred eighty days after a protest is filed.  Unless waived by the parties, failure to do so shall be deemed a determination that good cause does not exist for refusing to permit the proposed new or relocated dealer, unless such delay is caused by acts of the manufacturer or distributor or the relocating or new dealer.


(e) Any parties to a hearing by the commissioner concerning the establishing or relocating of a dealer may appeal any decision or order of the commissioner in accordance with 
section 4-183

Sec. 1.1. There is hereby created the Northeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Compact.  The party states recognize that the Congress has declared that each state is responsible for providing for the availability of capacity, either within or outside its borders, for disposal of low-level radioactive waste generated within its borders, except for waste generated as a result of atomic energy defense activities of the federal government, as defined in the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act (
P.L. 96-573
, “The Act”),   1 or federal research and development activities.  They recognize that the management of low-level radioactive waste is handled most efficiently on a regional basis.  The party states further recognize that the Congress of the United States, by enacting the Act has provided for and encouraged the development of regional low-level radioactive waste compacts to manage such waste.  The party states further recognize that the long-term, safe and efficient management of low-level radioactive waste generated within the region requires that sufficient capacity to manage such waste be properly provided.
In order to promote the health and safety of the region, it is the policy of the party states to:  Enter into a regional low-level radioactive waste management compact as a means of facilitating an interstate cooperative effort;  provide for proper transportation of low-level waste generated in the region;  minimize the number of facilities required to effectively and efficiently manage low-level radioactive waste generated in the region;  encourage the reduction of the amounts of low-level waste generated in the region, distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of proper low-level radioactive waste management equitably among the party states and ensure the environmentally sound and economical management of low-level radioactive waste.

Sec. 5.1. The commission shall develop, adopt, maintain and implement a regional management plan to ensure the safe and efficient management of waste within the region.  The plan shall include the following:

(a) A current inventory of all generators within the region;  a current inventory of all facilities within the region, including information on the size, capacity, location, specific waste being handled, and projected useful life of each facility;


(b) A determination of the type and number of regional facilities which are presently necessary and projected to be necessary to manage waste generated within the region consistent with considerations for public health and safety as defined by appropriate regulatory authorities;  and


(c) Reference guidelines, as defined by appropriate regulatory authorities, for the party states for establishing the criteria and procedures to evaluate locations for regional facilities.


Sec. 5.2. The commission shall develop and adopt criteria and procedures for reviewing a party state which volunteers to host a regional facility within its borders.  These criteria shall be developed with public notice and shall include the following factors:  The capability of the volunteering party state to host a regional facility in a timely manner and to ensure its postclosure observation and maintenance and institutional control, and the anticipated economic feasibility of the proposed facility.  Any party state may set terms and conditions to encourage a party state to volunteer to be the first host state.  Consistent with the review required above, the commission shall, upon a two-thirds affirmative vote, designate a volunteering party state to serve as a host state.

Sec. 5.3. If all regional facilities required by the regional management plan are not developed pursuant to section 5.2 of this Article, or upon notification that an existing facility is to be closed, or upon determination that an additional regional facility is or may be required, the commission shall convene to consider designation of a host state.

Sec. 5.4. The commission shall develop and adopt procedures for designating a party state to be a host state for a regional facility.  The commission shall base its decision on the following criteria:  The health, safety and welfare of citizens of the party states as defined by the appropriate regulatory authorities;  the environmental, economic and social effects of a regional facility on the party states;  economic benefits and costs;  the volumes and types of waste generated within each party state;  the minimization of waste transportation, and the existence of regional facilities within the party states.  Following its established criteria and procedures, the commission shall designate by a two-thirds affirmative vote a party state to serve as a host state.  A current host state shall have the right of first refusal for a succeeding regional facility.  The commission shall conduct such hearings and studies, and take such evidence and testimony as is required by its approved procedures prior to designating a host state.  Public hearings shall be held upon request in each candidate host state prior to final evaluation and selection.  A party state which has been designated as a host state by the commission and which fails to fulfill its obligations as a host state may have its privileges under the compact suspended or membership in the compact revoked by the commission.

Sec. 5.5. Each host state shall be responsible for the timely identification of a site and the timely development and operation of a regional facility.  The proposed facility shall meet geological, environmental and economic criteria which shall not conflict with applicable federal and host state laws and regulations.  To the extent not prohibited by federal law, a host state may regulate and license any facility within its borders.  To the extent not prohibited by federal law, a host state shall ensure the safe operation, closure, postclosure observation and maintenance and institutional control of a facility, including adequate financial assurances by the operator and adequate emergency response procedures.  It shall periodically review and report to the commission on the status of the postclosure and institutional control funds and the remaining useful life of the facility.  A host state shall solicit comments from each party state and the commission regarding the siting, operation, financial assurances, closure, postclosure observation and maintenance and institutional control of a regional facility.

Sec. 5.6. A host state intending to close a regional facility within its borders shall notify the commission in writing of its intention and the reasons therefor.  Except as otherwise provided, such notification shall be given to the commission at least five years prior to the scheduled date of closure.  A host state may close a regional facility within its borders in the event of an emergency or if a condition exists which constitutes a substantial threat to public health and safety.  A host state shall notify the commission in writing within three days of its action and shall, within thirty working days, show justification for the closing.  In the event that a regional facility closes before an additional or new facility becomes operational, the commission shall make interim arrangements for the storage or disposal of waste generated within the region until such time as a new regional facility is operational.

Sec. 5.7. Fees and surcharges shall be imposed equitably upon all users of a regional facility, based upon criteria established by the commission.  A host state shall, according to its lawful administrative procedures, approve fee schedules to be charged to all users of the regional facility within its borders.  Except as provided herein, such fee schedules shall be established by the operator of a regional facility, under applicable state regulations, and shall be reasonable under applicable state regulations and shall be reasonable and sufficient to cover all costs related to the development, operation, closure, postclosure observation and maintenance and institutional control of the regional facility.  The host state shall determine a schedule for contributions to the postclosure observation and maintenance and institutional control funds.  Such fee schedules shall not be approved unless the commission has been given reasonable opportunity to review and make recommendations on the proposed fee schedules.  A host state may, according to its lawful administrative procedures, impose a state surcharge per unit of waste received at any regional facility within its borders.  The state surcharge shall be in addition to the fees charged for water management.  The surcharge shall be sufficient to cover all reasonable costs associated with administration and regulation of the facility.  The surcharge shall not be established unless the commission has been provided reasonable opportunity to review and make recommendations on the proposed state surcharge.  The commission shall impose a commission surcharge per unit of waste received at any regional facility.  The total moneys collected shall be adequate to pay the costs and expenses of the commission and shall be remitted to the commission on a timely basis as determined by the commission.  The surcharge may be increased or decreased as the commission deems necessary.  Nothing herein shall be construed to limit the ability of the host state, or the political subdivision in which the regional facility is situated, to impose surcharges for purposes including, but not limited to, host community compensation and host community development incentives.  Such surcharges shall be reasonable and shall not be imposed unless the commission has been provided reasonable opportunity to review and make recommendations on the proposed surcharge.  Such surcharge may be recovered through the approved fee and surcharge schedules provided for in this section.


Sec. 5.1. The commission shall develop, adopt, maintain and implement a regional management plan to ensure the safe and efficient management of waste within the region.  The plan shall include the following:

(a) A current inventory of all generators within the region;  a current inventory of all facilities within the region, including information on the size, capacity, location, specific waste being handled, and projected useful life of each facility;

(c) All open market orders or contracts shall be awarded to (1) the lowest responsible qualified bidder, the qualities of the articles to be supplied, their conformity with the specifications, their suitability to the requirements of the state government and the delivery terms being taken into consideration and, at the discretion of the Commissioner of Administrative Services, life-cycle costs and trade-in or resale value of the articles may be considered where it appears to be in the best interest of the state, (2) the highest scoring bidder in a multiple criteria bid, in accordance with the criteria set forth in the bid solicitation for the contract, or (3) the proposer whose proposal is deemed by the awarding authority to be the most advantageous to the state, in accordance with the criteria set forth in the request for proposals, including price and evaluation factors.  Notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, each state agency awarding a contract through competitive negotiation shall include price as an explicit factor in the criteria in the request for proposals and for the contract award.  In considering past performance of a bidder for the purpose of determining the “lowest responsible qualified bidder” or the “highest scoring bidder in a multiple criteria bid”, the commissioner shall evaluate the skill, ability and integrity of the bidder in terms of the bidder's fulfillment of past contract obligations and the bidder's experience or lack of experience in delivering supplies, materials, equipment or contractual services of the size or amount for which bids have been solicited.  In determining the lowest responsible qualified bidder for the purposes of this section, the commissioner may give a price preference of up to ten per cent for (A) the purchase of goods made with recycled materials or the purchase of recyclable or remanufactured products if the commissioner determines that such preference would promote recycling or remanufacturing.  As used in this subsection, “recyclable” means able to be collected, separated or otherwise recovered from the solid waste stream for reuse, or for use in the manufacture or assembly of another package or product, by means of a recycling program which is reasonably available to at least seventy-five per cent of the state's population, “remanufactured” means restored to its original function and thereby diverted from the solid waste stream by retaining the bulk of components that have been used at least once and by replacing consumable components and “remanufacturing” means any process by which a product is remanufactured;  (B) the purchase of motor vehicles powered by a clean alternative fuel;  (C) the purchase of motor vehicles powered by fuel other than a clean alternative fuel and conversion equipment to convert such motor vehicles allowing the vehicles to be powered by either the exclusive use of clean alternative fuel or dual use of a clean alternative fuel and a fuel other than a clean alternative fuel.  As used in this subsection, “clean alternative fuel” means natural gas, electricity, hydrogen or propane when used as a motor vehicle fuel;  or (D) the purchase of goods or services from a micro business, except that, in the case of a veteran-owned micro business, the commissioner may give a price preference of up to fifteen per cent.  As used in this subsection, “micro business” means a business with gross revenues not exceeding three million dollars in the most recently completed fiscal year and “veteran-owned micro business” means a micro business of which at least fifty-one per cent of the ownership is held by one or more veterans, as defined in subsection (a) of 
section 27-103
.  All other factors being equal, preference shall be given to supplies, materials and equipment produced, assembled or manufactured in the state and services originating and provided in the state.  Except with regard to contracts that may be paid for with United States Department of Transportation funds, if any such bidder refuses to accept, within ten days, a contract awarded to such bidder, such contract may be awarded to the next lowest responsible qualified bidder or the next highest scoring bidder in a multiple criteria bid, whichever is applicable, and so on until such contract is awarded and accepted.  Except with regard to contracts that may be paid for with United States Department of Transportation funds, if any such proposer refuses to accept, within ten days, a contract awarded to such proposer, such contract shall be awarded to the next most advantageous proposer, and so on until the contract is awarded and accepted.  There shall be a written evaluation made of each bid.  This evaluation shall identify the vendors and their respective costs and prices, document the reason why any vendor is deemed to be nonresponsive and recommend a vendor for award.  A contract valued at one million dollars or more shall be awarded to a bidder other than the lowest responsible qualified bidder or the highest scoring bidder in a multiple criteria bid, whichever is applicable, only with written approval signed by the Commissioner of Administrative Services and by the Comptroller.  The commissioner shall post on the department's Internet web site all awards made pursuant to the provisions of this section.


(d) When, in the opinion of the commissioner, the best interest of the state will be served thereby, the commissioner may order that any or all bids or proposals may be rejected.  If all bids or proposals are so rejected, the commissioner shall advertise again for bids or proposals and such bids or proposals shall be opened, awarded and approved in like manner as provided in this section and 
section 4a-57
.  If all bids or proposals received on a pending contract are for the same unit price or total amount and no distinction can be made in favor of supplies, materials and equipment produced, assembled or manufactured in the state or services originating and provided in the state, the commissioner shall have authority to order the rejection of all bids or proposals and to order the purchase of the required supplies, materials, equipment or contractual services in the open market, provided the price paid in the open market shall not exceed the bid or proposal price.


(e) Each bid or proposal, with the name of the bidder, or proposer, shall be entered on a record, and each record, with the successful bid or proposal indicated thereon, shall, after the award of the order or contract, be open to public inspection.  All contracts shall be approved as to form by the Attorney General and a copy of each contract shall be filed with the Comptroller.


(f) Not later than February 1, 2002, the Commissioner of Administrative Services shall adopt regulations, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54,   1 indicating the types of objective criteria that the commissioner may use in determining the highest scoring bidder in a multiple criteria bid under this section.  Said commissioner shall submit a report on said date, concerning the status of the adoption of said regulations by the commissioner, to the joint standing committee of the General Assembly having cognizance of matters relating to government administration.

(b) In making its decision, the council shall consider:  (1) The impact of the proposed facility on the municipality and affected geographic area in which it is to be located in terms of public health, safety and welfare including but not limited to (A) the risk and impact of accident during transportation of hazardous waste, (B) the risk and impact of fires or explosions from improper storage or disposal methods, (C) consistency of the proposed facility with local and regional land use plans and regulations and the state conservation and development plan in effect at the time the applicant applies to the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection for the environmental licenses, permits, or approvals necessary to construct and operate the facility, and with existing and proposed development in the area, (D) the protection of the public from adverse impacts including but not limited to adverse economic impacts of the facility during its construction and operation and after its operation life, (E) the risk and impact on public and private drinking water supplies;  (2) the population density in the area of the proposed facility and its proximity to residential areas;  (3) data available under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986   1 concerning permitted and illegal discharges in the geographical area affected by the proposed facility;  (4) the proximity of the proposed facility to schools;  (5) the availability of other sites; and (6) other criteria consistent with the goal of insuring the maximum safety of the public from potential dangers associated with the siting and the development and management of construction of hazardous waste facilities which may be established by regulation adopted by the permanent members of the council in accordance with the provisions of subsection (c) of 
section 22a-116
.  The permanent members of the council shall adopt regulations in accordance with the provisions of said chapter establishing minimum distances between the active parts of the facility and other land uses.


(c) The council shall not grant a certificate unless it finds and determines:  (1) A public need and the basis of such need for the facility;  (2) the nature of the probable health and environmental impact of the facility including but not limited to those listed in subsection (b) of this section and consideration of the number of persons affected;  (3) in the case of a proposed land disposal facility, an explanation of why no other disposal method is more appropriate;  (4) every significant single and cumulative adverse effect on and conflict with state policies on (A) the natural environment, (B) the ecological balance, (C) the public health and safety, (D) scenic, historic and recreational values, (E) forests and parks, (F) air and water purity, including impact on present and future sources of water supply;  and (5) why such adverse effects or conflicts set forth in subdivision (4) of this subsection are not sufficient for denial of the certificate.  Any applicant who withdraws an application submitted under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,   2 this chapter or the regulations adopted pursuant to subsection (c) of

P.L. 96-510
).   3  To the extent that liability incurred during the postclosure period is to be paid from funds established in accordance with said act, the applicant shall not be required to maintain such fund or other security;  (4) the applicant pays the costs, if any, incurred by the state for preparation of an off-site emergency plan for a worst case accident.

(6) The commissioner, upon application, shall issue an eligibility certificate for an insurance business occupying a new facility in this state and employing new employees, after it has been established, to his satisfaction, that subject insurance business has complied with the provisions of this subsection.  If the commissioner determines that such requirements have been met as a result of transactions with a related person for other than bona fide business purposes, he shall deny such application.  The commissioner shall require the subject insurance business to submit annually such information as may be necessary to determine whether the appropriate occupancy and employment requirements have been met at all times during an income year.  If the commissioner determines that such requirements have been so met, he shall issue a certification of continued eligibility to that effect to the subject insurance business on or before the first day of the third month following the close of the subject insurance business's income year.

Connecticut General Statutes Title 22A. Environmental Protection § 22a-309. New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Compact,https://codes.findlaw.com/ct/title-22a-environmental-protection/ct-gen-st-sect-22a-309.html,"ARTICLE IIt is agreed between the signatory states that the provisions of this compact shall apply to streams, ponds and lakes which are contiguous to two or more signatory states or which flow through two or more signatory states or which have a tributary contiguous to two or more signatory states or flowing through two or more signatory states, and also shall apply to tidal waters ebbing and flowing past the boundaries of two states.
ARTICLE IIThere is hereby created the New England Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission (hereinafter referred to as the commission) which shall be a body corporate and politic, having the powers, duties and jurisdiction herein enumerated and such other and additional powers as shall be conferred upon it by the act or acts of a signatory state concurred in by the others.
ARTICLE IIIThe commission shall consist of five commissioners from each signatory state, each of whom shall be a resident voter of the state from which he is appointed.  The commissioners shall be chosen in the manner and for the terms provided by law of the state from which they shall be appointed.  For each state there shall be on the commission a member representing the state health department, a member representing the state water pollution control board (if such exists), and, except where a state in its enabling legislation decides that the best interests of the state will be otherwise served, a member representing municipal interests, a member representing industrial interests, and a member representing an agency acting for fisheries or conservation.
ARTICLE IVThe commission shall annually elect from its members a chairman and vice chairman and shall appoint and at its pleasure remove or discharge such officers.  It may appoint and employ a secretary who shall be a professional engineer versed in water pollution and may employ such stenographic or clerical employees as shall be necessary, and at its pleasure remove or discharge such employees.  It shall adopt a seal and suitable bylaws and shall promulgate rules and regulations for its management and control.  It may maintain an office for the transaction of its business and may meet at any time or place within the signatory states.  Meetings shall be held at least twice each year.  A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of its business but no action of the commission imposing any obligation on any signatory state or on any municipal agency or subdivision thereof or on any person, firm or corporation therein shall be binding unless a majority of the members from such signatory state shall have voted in favor thereof.  Where meetings are planned to discuss matters relevant to problems of water pollution control affecting only certain of the signatory states, the commission may vote to authorize special meetings of the commissioners of the states especially concerned.  The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements and shall make an annual report to the governor and the legislature of each signatory state setting forth in detail the operations and transactions conducted by it pursuant to this compact, and shall make recommendations for any legislative action deemed by it advisable, including amendments to the statutes of the signatory states which may be necessary to carry out the intent and purpose of this compact.  The commission shall not incur any obligations for salaries, office, administrative, traveling or other expenses prior to the allotment of funds by the signatory states adequate to meet the same;  nor shall the commission pledge the credit of any of the signatory states.  Each signatory state reserves the right to provide hereafter by law for the examination and audit of the accounts of the commission.  The commission shall appoint a treasurer who may be a member of the commission, and disbursements by the commission shall be valid only when authorized by the commission and when vouchers therefor have been signed by custodian of the records of the commission with authority to attest to and certify such records or copies thereof.
ARTICLE VIt is recognized, owing to such variable factors as location, size, character and flow and the many varied uses of the waters subject to the terms of this compact, that no single standard of sewage and waste treatment and no single standard of quality of receiving waters is practical and that the degree of treatment of sewage and industrial wastes should take into account the classification of the receiving waters according to present and proposed highest use, such as for drinking water supply, industrial and agricultural uses, bathing and other recreational purposes, maintenance and propagation of fish life, shellfish culture, navigation and disposal of wastes.The commission shall establish reasonable physical, chemical and bacteriological standards of water quality satisfactory for various classifications of use.  It is agreed that each of the signatory states through appropriate agencies will prepare a classification of its interstate waters in entirety or by portions according to present and proposed highest use and for this purpose technical experts employed by state departments of health and state water pollution control agencies are authorized to confer on questions relating to classification of interstate waters affecting two or more states.  Each signatory state agrees to submit its classification of its interstate waters to the commission for approval.  It is agreed that after such approval all signatory states through their appropriate state health departments and water pollution control agencies will work to establish programs of treatment of sewage and industrial wastes which will meet standards established by the commission for classified waters.  The commission may from time to time make such changes in definitions of classifications and in standards as may be required by changed conditions or as may be necessary for uniformity.
ARTICLE VIEach of the signatory states pledges to provide for the abatement of existing pollution and for the control of future pollution of interstate inland and tidal waters as described in Article I, and to put and maintain the waters thereof in a satisfactory condition consistent with the highest classified use of each body of water.
ARTICLE VIINothing in this compact shall be construed to repeal or prevent the enactment of any legislation or prevent the enforcement of any requirement by any signatory state imposing any additional condition or restriction to further lessen the pollution of waters within its jurisdiction.  Nothing herein contained shall affect or abate any action now pending brought by any governmental board or body created under any of the signatory states.
ARTICLE VIIIThe signatory states agree to appropriate for the salaries, office, administrative, travel and other expenses such sum or sums as shall be recommended by the commission.  The commonwealth of Massachusetts obligates itself only to the extent of sixty-five hundred dollars in any one year, the state of Connecticut only to the extent of three thousand dollars in any one year, the state of Rhode Island only to the extent of fifteen hundred dollars in any one year, and the states of New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont each only to the extent of one thousand dollars in any one year.
ARTICLE IXShould any part of this compact be held to be contrary to the constitution of any signatory state or of the United States, all other parts thereof shall continue to be in full force and effect.
ARTICLE XThe commission is authorized to discuss with appropriate state agencies in New York state questions of pollution of waters which flow into the New England area from New York state or vice versa and to further the establishment of agreements on pollution abatement to promote the interests of the New York and New England areas.Whenever the commission by majority vote of the members of each signatory state shall have given its approval and the state of New York shall have taken the necessary action to do so, the state of New York shall be a party to this compact for the purpose of controlling and abating the pollution of waterways common to New York and the New England states signatory to this compact but excluding the waters under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Environmental Commission (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut).
ARTICLE XIThis compact shall become effective immediately upon the adoption of the compact by any two contiguous states of New England but only in so far as applies to those states and upon approval by Federal law.  Thereafter upon ratification by other contiguous states, it shall also become effective as to those states.

Orders to persons engaged in agriculture for contamination of groundwater by pesticides,https://codes.findlaw.com/ct/title-22a-environmental-protection/ct-gen-st-sect-22a-471.html,"

(a) (1) If the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection determines that pollution of the groundwaters has occurred or can reasonably be expected to occur and the Commissioner of Public Health determines that the extent of pollution creates or can reasonably be expected to create an unacceptable risk of injury to the health or safety of persons using such groundwaters as a public or private source of water for drinking or other personal or domestic uses, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection may issue an order to the person or municipality responsible for such pollution requiring that potable drinking water be provided to all persons affected by such pollution.  In determining if pollution creates an unacceptable risk of injury, the Commissioner of Public Health shall balance all relevant and substantive facts and inferences and shall not be limited to a consideration of available statistical analysis but shall consider all of the evidence presented and any factor related to human health risks.  If the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection finds that more than one person or municipality is responsible for such pollution, the commissioner shall attempt to apportion responsibility if the commissioner determines that apportionment is appropriate.  If the commissioner does not apportion responsibility, all persons and municipalities responsible for the pollution of the groundwaters shall be jointly and severally responsible for the providing of potable drinking water to persons affected by such pollution.  If the commissioner determines that the state or an agency or department of the state is responsible in whole or in part for the pollution of the groundwaters, such agency or department shall prepare or arrange for the preparation of an engineering report and shall provide or arrange for the provision of a long-term potable drinking water supply.  If the commissioner is unable to determine the person or municipality responsible or if the commissioner determines that the responsible persons have no assets other than land, buildings, business machinery or livestock and are unable to secure a loan at a reasonable rate of interest to provide potable drinking water, the commissioner may prepare or arrange for the preparation of an engineering report and provide or arrange for the provision of a long-term potable drinking water supply or the commissioner may issue an order to the municipality wherein groundwaters unusable for potable drinking water are located requiring that short-term provision of potable drinking water be made to those existing residential buildings and elementary and secondary schools affected by such pollution and that long-term provision of potable drinking water be made to all persons affected by such pollution.  For purposes of this section, “residential building” means any house, apartment, trailer, mobile manufactured home or other structure occupied by individuals as a dwelling, except a non-owner-occupied hotel or motel or a correctional institution.


(2) Any order issued pursuant to this section may require the provision of potable drinking water in such quantities as the commissioner determines are necessary for drinking and other personal and domestic uses and may require the maintenance and monitoring of potable water supply facilities for any period which the commissioner determines is necessary.  In making such determinations, the commissioner shall consider the short-term and long-term needs for potable drinking water and the health and safety of those persons whose water supply is unusable.  Any order may require the submission of an engineering report which shall be subject to the approval of the commissioner and the Commissioner of Public Health and include, but not be limited to, a description in detail of the problem, area and population affected by pollution of the groundwaters;  the expected duration of and extent of the pollution;  alternate solutions including relative cost of construction or installation, operation and maintenance;  design criteria on all alternate solutions;  and any other information which the commissioner deems necessary.  Upon review of such report, the commissioner and the Commissioner of Public Health shall consider the nature of the pollution, the expected duration and extent of the pollution, the health and safety of the persons affected, the initial and ongoing cost-effectiveness and reliability of each alternative and any other factors which they deem relevant, and shall approve a system or method to provide potable drinking water pursuant to the order.  Each order shall include a time schedule for the accomplishment of the steps leading to the provision of potable drinking water.  Notwithstanding the fact that a responsible party has been or may be identified or a request for a hearing on or a pending appeal from an order issued pursuant to this section, when pollution of the groundwaters has occurred or may reasonably be expected to occur, the commissioner may prepare or arrange for the preparation of an engineering report as described in this subdivision and may provide or arrange for the provision of a long-term potable drinking water supply.  In any case where the state or an agency or department of the state is responsible in whole or in part for the pollution of the groundwaters, such agency or department shall prepare or arrange for the preparation of an engineering report and shall provide or arrange for the provision of a long-term potable drinking water supply, and if the state is not the sole responsible party, the commissioner shall seek reimbursement under subdivision (4) of subsection (b) of this section for the costs of such report and for the provision of potable water.  The cost of the report and of the provision of a long-term potable drinking water supply, as funds allow, shall be paid from the proceeds of any bonds authorized for the provision of potable drinking water.


(3) The provisions of this section shall not affect the rights of any municipality to institute suit to recover all damages, expenses and costs incurred by the municipality from any responsible party, including, but not limited to, the costs specified in subparagraph (B)(i) and (ii) of subdivision (4) of subsection (b) of this section and, in the case of any municipality which is not responsible for the pollution of the groundwaters, the additional amounts specified in subparagraph (B)(iii) and (iv) of subdivision (4) of subsection (b) of this section.


(4) No provision of this section shall limit the liability of any person who or municipality which renders the groundwaters unusable for potable drinking water from a suit for damages by a person who or municipality which relied on said groundwaters for potable drinking water prior to the determination by the commissioner that the groundwaters are polluted.


(5) The commissioner may issue any order pursuant to this section if the pollution of the groundwaters occurred before or after July 1, 1982.


(6) The commissioner may at any time require further action by any person to whom or municipality to which an order is issued pursuant to this section if the commissioner determines that such action is necessary to protect the health and safety of those persons whose water supply was rendered unusable.



(a) (1) If the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection determines that pollution of the groundwaters has occurred or can reasonably be expected to occur and the Commissioner of Public Health determines that the extent of pollution creates or can reasonably be expected to create an unacceptable risk of injury to the health or safety of persons using such groundwaters as a public or private source of water for drinking or other personal or domestic uses, the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection may issue an order to the person or municipality responsible for such pollution requiring that potable drinking water be provided to all persons affected by such pollution.  In determining if pollution creates an unacceptable risk of injury, the Commissioner of Public Health shall balance all relevant and substantive facts and inferences and shall not be limited to a consideration of available statistical analysis but shall consider all of the evidence presented and any factor related to human health risks.  If the Commissioner of Energy and Environmental Protection finds that more than one person or municipality is responsible for such pollution, the commissioner shall attempt to apportion responsibility if the commissioner determines that apportionment is appropriate.  If the commissioner does not apportion responsibility, all persons and municipalities responsible for the pollution of the groundwaters shall be jointly and severally responsible for the providing of potable drinking water to persons affected by such pollution.  If the commissioner determines that the state or an agency or department of the state is responsible in whole or in part for the pollution of the groundwaters, such agency or department shall prepare or arrange for the preparation of an engineering report and shall provide or arrange for the provision of a long-term potable drinking water supply.  If the commissioner is unable to determine the person or municipality responsible or if the commissioner determines that the responsible persons have no assets other than land, buildings, business machinery or livestock and are unable to secure a loan at a reasonable rate of interest to provide potable drinking water, the commissioner may prepare or arrange for the preparation of an engineering report and provide or arrange for the provision of a long-term potable drinking water supply or the commissioner may issue an order to the municipality wherein groundwaters unusable for potable drinking water are located requiring that short-term provision of potable drinking water be made to those existing residential buildings and elementary and secondary schools affected by such pollution and that long-term provision of potable drinking water be made to all persons affected by such pollution.  For purposes of this section, “residential building” means any house, apartment, trailer, mobile manufactured home or other structure occupied by individuals as a dwelling, except a non-owner-occupied hotel or motel or a correctional institution.

(b) The commissioner shall not approve the conversion unless the commissioner makes the considerations, determinations and findings required by subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this section.

(d) The commissioner shall not approve the conversion unless the commissioner determines that:  (1) The converting credit union has complied with all applicable provisions of law;  (2) the converting credit union has equity capital at least equal to the minimum equity capital required for the organization of the type of mutual Connecticut bank to which it is converting;  (3) the proposed conversion will serve the public necessity and convenience;  (4) conditions in the locality in which the proposed mutual Connecticut bank will transact business afford reasonable promise of successful operation;  (5) the proposed directors and executive officers possess capacity and fitness for the duties and responsibilities with which they will be charged;  and (6) the programs, policies and procedures of the converting credit union relating to anti-money-laundering activity are adequate, and the converting credit union has a record of compliance with anti-money-laundering laws and regulations.  If the commissioner cannot make such determination with respect to any such proposed director or proposed executive officer, the commissioner may refuse to allow such proposed director or proposed executive officer to serve in such capacity in the proposed mutual Connecticut bank.  As used in this subsection, “executive officer” means every officer of the proposed mutual Connecticut bank who participates or has authority to participate, other than in the capacity of a director, in major policy-making functions of the proposed mutual Connecticut bank, regardless of whether such officer has an official title or whether such officer's title contains a designation of assistant or whether such officer serves without salary or other compensation.  The vice president, the chief financial officer, secretary and treasurer of the proposed mutual Connecticut bank are presumed to be executive officers, unless, by resolution of the governing board or by the proposed mutual Connecticut bank's bylaws, any such officer is excluded from participation in major policy-making functions, other than in the capacity of a director of the proposed mutual Connecticut bank, and such officer does not actually participate in major policy-making functions.

(f) If the conversion is approved by the commissioner and the commissioner receives notification from the converting credit union that all approvals required under federal law, including approvals needed for deposit insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor agency have been obtained and that any waiting period prescribed by federal law has expired, a certificate of authority to commence business shall be issued by the commissioner.  After receipt of the certificate of authority, the converting credit union shall promptly file such certificate of authority and its certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of the State and with the town clerk of the town in which its principal office is located.  Upon such filing, the license of the converting credit union shall automatically lapse and the converting credit union shall cease to be a credit union and shall become a mutual savings bank, mutual savings and loan association or mutual community bank, as the case may be.  Upon such conversion, the converted mutual Connecticut bank shall possess all of the rights, privileges and powers granted to it by its certificate of incorporation and by the provisions of the general statutes applicable to the type of institution into which it converted, and all of the assets and business of the converting credit union shall be transferred to and vested in it without any deed or instrument of conveyance, provided the converting credit union may execute any deed or instrument of conveyance as is convenient to confirm such transfer.  The converted mutual Connecticut bank shall be subject to all of the duties, relations, obligations and liabilities of the converting credit union, whether as debtor, depository or otherwise, and shall be liable to pay and discharge all such debts and liabilities, to perform all such duties in the same manner and to the same extent as if the converted mutual Connecticut bank had itself incurred the obligation or liability or assumed the duty or relation.  All rights of creditors of the converting credit union and all liens upon the property of such credit union shall be preserved unimpaired and the converted mutual Connecticut bank shall be entitled to receive, accept, collect, hold and enjoy any and all gifts, bequests, devises, conveyances and appointments in favor of or in the name of the converting credit union and whether made or created to take effect prior to or after the conversion.


(g) Within ninety days after the conversion, the converted mutual Connecticut bank shall record a certificate, signed by the secretary and stating that the conversion is effective, in the office of the town clerk in each town in this state where the converted mutual Connecticut bank owns real property.


(h) The converted mutual Connecticut bank may not exercise any of the fiduciary powers granted to Connecticut banks by law until express authority therefor has been given by the commissioner.

(8) Points shall be subtracted, applying the formula in subdivision (6) of this subsection, for any affordable dwelling unit which, on or after July 1, 1990, was affected by any action taken by a municipality which caused such dwelling unit to cease being counted as an affordable dwelling unit.


(9) A newly-constructed unit shall be counted toward a moratorium when it receives a certificate of occupancy.  A newly-restricted unit shall be counted toward a moratorium when its deed restriction takes effect.


(10) The affordable housing appeals procedure shall be applicable to affordable housing applications filed with a commission after a three-year moratorium expires, except (A) as otherwise provided in subsection (k) of this section, or (B) when sufficient unit-equivalent points have been created within the municipality during one moratorium to qualify for a subsequent moratorium.


(11) The commissioner shall, within available appropriations, adopt regulations in accordance with chapter 54 to carry out the purposes of this subsection.  Such regulations shall specify the procedure to be followed by a municipality to obtain a moratorium, and shall include the manner in which a municipality is to document the units to be counted toward a moratorium.  A municipality may apply for a moratorium in accordance with the provisions of this subsection prior to, as well as after, such regulations are adopted.


(m) The commissioner shall, pursuant to regulations adopted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 54, promulgate model deed restrictions which satisfy the requirements of this section.  A municipality may waive any fee which would otherwise be required for the filing of any long-term affordability deed restriction on the land records.

Emergency Management Assistance Compact,https://codes.findlaw.com/ct/title-28-civil-preparedness-and-emergency-services/ct-gen-st-sect-28-23a.html,"Article I. Purposes and Authorities.This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states.  For the purposes of this agreement, the term “states” is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all United States territorial possessions.The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the Governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency or enemy attack.This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods.  Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.
Article II. General Implementation.Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact.  Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency.  This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.The prompt, full and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.On behalf of the Governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.

vii. Provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes.


B. The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state.  The provisions of this agreement shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives.  Requests may be verbal or in writing.  If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty days of the verbal request.  Requests shall provide the following information:

i. A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, such as but not limited to, fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical services, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services and search and rescue.


ii. The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed, and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed.


iii. The specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location.


C. There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States government, with free exchange of information, plans and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.

Article VII. Supplementary Agreements.Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this instrument contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein contained shall preclude any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states.  Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel and equipment and supplies.
Article VIII. Compensation.Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.

section 45a-82
.  The requirement to file a statement under this subsection shall not apply with respect to any calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2011.


(b) Payments on behalf of deceased judge of probate.  The personal representative of each person who holds the office of judge of probate, at any time during any calendar year, and dies while in office, or within twenty-four months after ceasing to hold office, shall file with the Probate Court Administrator, on or before March first next following such death, a statement signed under penalty of false statement showing the actual gross receipts and itemized costs of the decedent's office for the preceding calendar year and the decedent's net income from that office for such calendar year.  The personal representative shall file with the Probate Court Administrator on or before March first of the second year following said death a statement signed under penalty of false statement showing the net income to the decedent's estate from such office for the preceding calendar year.  The requirement to file a statement under this subsection shall not apply with respect to any calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2011.

As used in this subsection, “maximum amount” means the amount of annual net income from such office which, when applying the percentage payments set forth above, shall result in the judge of probate retaining as net compensation, after the payment of the above amounts, no more than the product resulting from the multiplication of seventy-two dollars by the annual weighted-workload of the court, as defined in regulations issued by the Probate Court Administrator pursuant to subsection (b) of 
section 45a-77
, but not to exceed the compensation of a high volume court as set forth in subsection (k) of this section, provided this limitation shall not apply to those courts described in subsection (k) of this section.  Such payment shall be deemed to be a necessary expense of such office, but shall not be deductible from the gross income for the purpose of determining net income of such office under this section.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the annual minimum compensation of a judge of probate shall be no less than the product resulting from the multiplication of fifteen dollars by the annual weighted-workload of the court, as defined in regulations issued by the Probate Court Administrator pursuant to subsection (b) of 
section 45a-77
, or no less than the judge's average compensation for the three-year period from January 1, 1996, to December 31, 1998, but, in no event shall that minimum compensation exceed that provided pursuant to subsection (k) of this section.


(d) Payments by Probate Court Administrator.  (1) Any judge of probate who is the Probate Court Administrator shall pay to the State Treasurer, to be credited to said fund, one hundred per cent of the annual net income from his office during the period of time he serves as Probate Court Administrator.  (2) For the purposes of this assessment, fees received after but earned before his appointment as Probate Court Administrator shall be subject to the assessment set forth in the table in subsection (c) of this section.  Fees received after such judge of probate ceases to be the Probate Court Administrator but earned during his term as Probate Court Administrator shall be paid in full to the State Treasurer after the deduction of the expenses of his office.  (3) The books and records of any judge of probate acting as Probate Court Administrator shall be audited by the Auditors of Public Accounts at the beginning of his term as Probate Court Administrator and thereafter at least annually during his term as Probate Court Administrator and upon completion of his term as Probate Court Administrator or as judge of probate whichever occurs first.  (4) A judge of probate who is Probate Court Administrator shall make no expenditure in his court for salaries, equipment, or any other expenditure exceeding the sum of one hundred dollars in the aggregate, annually, without first having obtained the approval of the Chief Court Administrator.


(e) Estimate of annual net income. (1) On or before January thirty-first of each year, each person required to make payment under this section shall estimate such annual net income and shall advise the Probate Court Administrator thereof, upon such forms and pursuant to such regulations as said administrator shall promulgate.  (2) Each person who takes office as a judge of probate after February first of any calendar year, as the result of death, retirement, resignation or removal of the immediately previous incumbent of that office, shall file his estimate of annual net income with the Probate Court Administrator and shall make the necessary payment to the State Treasurer in accordance therewith not later than sixty days after taking office.  (3) The requirement to estimate such annual net income and advise the Probate Court Administrator thereof under subdivision (1) of this subsection, and the requirement to file an estimate with the Probate Court Administrator under subdivision (2) of this subsection, shall not apply with respect to any calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2011.


(f) Payments to State Treasurer.  If, based upon such estimate, the amount payable shall be less than one hundred dollars, the payment thereof shall be made in one payment on or before December thirty-first of the applicable year.  Otherwise, the amount payable shall be made in four substantially equal installments payable on or before the last day of March, June, September and December of the applicable year, except that in the case of an estimate filed pursuant to subdivision (2) of subsection (e) of this section, the amount payable under such estimate shall be made in substantially equal installments on such installment payment dates next following the timely filing of such estimate in such year.  The estimated payment may be amended and changed at any time during the year in which it is payable by increasing or decreasing the amount.  The amount of such increase or decrease shall be paid for or adjusted in the installment or payment due at the time the estimated assessment is next payable after such amendment.  The Probate Court Administrator may issue regulations pursuant to subsection (b) of 
section 45a-77
 to implement this subsection.


(g) Report of income.  Upon the completion of each calendar year, and in any event on or before the first day of April of the succeeding calendar year, each person required to make payment under this section shall make a report signed under penalty of false statement to the Probate Court Administrator, upon forms prescribed by and subject to regulations promulgated by the administrator, of the following:  (1) The gross income received by virtue of such office;  (2) actual expenses incurred in connection with the office;  (3) the net income of such office prior to the payment of the assessment installments hereinbefore provided;  (4) the amount paid during the preceding calendar year to the State Treasurer on account of the foregoing estimate;  and (5) the amount of the difference, if any, between the amount so paid and the amount actually due.  Such report shall be open to public inspection.  The requirement to make a report under this subsection shall not apply with respect to any calendar year beginning on or after January 1, 2011.


(h) Deficiency and overpayment.  If the amount already paid was less than the amount due, such person shall, on or before March first of the succeeding calendar year, pay to the State Treasurer the entire deficiency.  If the amount already paid was more than the amount due, such person shall either, at such person's election and pursuant to regulations promulgated by the State Treasurer, be entitled to a refund of such excess payment to be paid from the fund provided by 
section 45a-82
, or a credit in the amount of the overpayment to be charged against the future obligations of such person to said fund.


(i) Penalty for deficiency.  (1) If any estimated quarterly payments required to be paid pursuant to subsection (f) of this section are less than one-fourth of seventy per cent of the total assessment due for that year or less than one-fourth of ninety-five per cent of the assessment paid for the prior year, such person shall be obligated to pay to such fund a penalty of ten per cent of the amount of the deficiency, except that the Probate Court Administrator may waive such penalty for cause in accordance with regulations issued pursuant to subsection (b) of 
section 45a-77
.  Any such penalty shall become payable upon demand by the Probate Court Administrator, and be due within thirty days after such demand, in accordance with regulations issued by the Probate Court Administrator, and shall be subject to interest under subdivision (2) of this subsection in the event of default in such payment.  (2) Any payments required under subsection (f) or (h) of this section which are not paid at the applicable times prescribed in said subsections, and any penalty payment required under subdivision (1) of this subsection which is not timely paid, shall incur simple interest at the rate applicable under 
section 12-376
 for delinquent payment of succession and transfer taxes where no extension has been granted, to be payable to the State Treasurer and to be added to the Probate Court Administration Fund established under 
section 45a-82
.  Any alleged delinquency of a judge of probate in making payments as required under this section shall be referred by the State Treasurer to the Attorney General for such action as the Attorney General deems necessary.


(j) Calculation of expenses;  net operating loss.  (1) As used in this subsection and subsections (c) to (i), inclusive, of this section, for any calendar year, the term “actual expenses incurred in connection therewith” may include as an allowable deduction the amount of any net operating loss for a prior calendar year as provided in this section.  (2) The term “net operating loss” means the excess of itemized costs and expenses of office allowed by this section over the gross income.  A net operating loss may be deducted in the calendar year following the year in which the net operating loss occurred, but (A) if the net income of such subsequent year is not sufficient to pay all of such net operating loss, then the balance of such net operating loss may be deducted in the second calendar year following such net operating loss;  and (B) if the net income of such second calendar year is not sufficient to pay all of the remaining net operating loss, then the balance of such net operating loss may be deducted in the third calendar year following such net operating loss.  In no event shall any such net operating loss or part thereof be deductible for any report beyond the third calendar year in which it occurred.


(k) Compensation of judges in high volume courts.  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (c) of this section concerning percentage payments, a judge of probate who is the judge in a court of probate designated as a high volume court shall be permitted to retain as net compensation, before the payment of any amounts due under 
sections 45a-34
 to 
45a-54
, inclusive, and 
section 45a-75
, the sum which shall be the greater of (1) the net compensation resulting from the application of the percentages in subsection (c) of this section or (2) the compensation earned after payment of actual expenses of the office not to exceed seventy-five per cent of the amount of the salary of a Superior Court judge as determined in accordance with subsection (a) of 
section 51-47
 as determined on July first of the calendar year for which the assessments are being paid pursuant to this section.  If a judge of probate of a high volume court leaves office during a calendar year, or if a judge of probate of a high volume court assumes office and serves during a portion of the calendar year, the minimum net compensation provided in this section shall be prorated in accordance with the number of days served during the calendar year as the numerator, and three hundred sixty-five as the denominator.  For the purposes of this subsection, “high volume court” means a court of probate which serves a district having an estimated population of seventy thousand or more persons as reported in the State Register and Manual for the calendar year immediately preceding (A) the year for which the judge was elected, (B) the year in which such judge was elected, or (C) any year of the term of office of such judge.  The amount of assessment payable to the State Treasurer under this section shall be reduced by the amount necessary to provide to the judge the minimum compensation to which such judge is entitled under this section, and the estimates of annual net income required in subsections (e) and (f) of this section may be reduced accordingly.  Minimum compensation as provided in this section shall only be payable if all ordinary and necessary expenses of the court are paid.


(l) Applicability.  This section applies only to income received by the courts of probate prior to January 5, 2011, except that payments made under 
section 45a-93
 to a judge who leaves office or dies while in office shall be subject to the assessment under subsection (c) of this section regardless of when such payments are made.


(m) Compensation from January 1, 2011, to January 4, 2011.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the compensation of each probate judge in office during the period from January 1, 2011 to January 4, 2011, inclusive, shall be calculated by multiplying the judge's allowable compensation for calendar year 2010, as determined under the provisions of this section, by a fraction with the number of days served during such period as the numerator, and three hundred sixty-five as the denominator.

(a) The following general goals and policies are established by this chapter:

(1) To ensure that the development, preservation or use of the land and water resources of the coastal area proceeds in a manner consistent with the rights of private property owners and the capability of the land and water resources to support development, preservation or use without significantly disrupting either the natural environment or sound economic growth;


(2) To preserve and enhance coastal resources in accordance with the policies established by chapters 439,   1 440,   2 446i,   3 446k,   4 447,   5 474   6 and 477;   7


(3) To give high priority and preference to uses and facilities which are dependent upon proximity to the water or the shorelands immediately adjacent to marine and tidal waters;


(4) To resolve conflicts between competing uses on the shorelands adjacent to marine and tidal waters by giving preference to uses that minimize adverse impacts on natural coastal resources while providing long term and stable economic benefits;


(5) To consider in the planning process the potential impact of a rise in sea level, coastal flooding and erosion patterns on coastal development so as to minimize damage to and destruction of life and property and minimize the necessity of public expenditure and shoreline armoring to protect future new development from such hazards;


(6) To encourage public access to the waters of Long Island Sound by expansion, development and effective utilization of state-owned recreational facilities within the coastal area that are consistent with sound resource conservation procedures and constitutionally protected rights of private property owners;


(7) To conduct, sponsor and assist research in coastal matters to improve the data base upon which coastal land and water use decisions are made;

, has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:  (A) Ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;  (B) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected;  (C) return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return;  (D) make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services;  (E) provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles;  (F) equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states;  (G) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders;  (H) ensure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;  (I) establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact;  (J) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators;  (K) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;  (L) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity;  and (M) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise.  It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business.  Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact.  The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purposes and policies of the compact.

(t) Notwithstanding subsections (r) and (s) of this section, for a contractually bound community development entity, credit recapture for credits allowed by this section shall be governed by the terms of its allocation agreement with the community development financial institutions fund or, where such agreement is silent, by 
Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code
 and the regulations promulgated by the United States Treasury pursuant to said section.

Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision,https://codes.findlaw.com/ct/title-54-criminal-procedure/ct-gen-st-sect-54-133.html,"ARTICLE IPURPOSEThe compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the bylaws and rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to:  Track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions.The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 
4 USC Section 112 (1965)
, has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states:  To provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community;  to provide for the effective tracking, supervision and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states;  and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.In addition, this compact will:  Create an Interstate Commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact;  ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;  establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators;  monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;  and coordinate training and education regarding regulation of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.The compacting states recognize that there is no right of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated hereunder.It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.
