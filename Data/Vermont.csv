(a) The purpose of the Connectivity Initiative is to provide each service location in Vermont access to Internet service that is capable of speeds of at least 10 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload, or the FCC speed requirements established under Connect America Fund Phase II, whichever is higher, beginning with locations not served as of December 31, 2013 according to the minimum technical service characteristic objectives applicable at that time.  Within this category of service locations, priority shall be given first to unserved and then to underserved locations.  As used in this section, “unserved” means a location having access to only satellite or dial-up Internet service and “underserved” means a location having access to Internet service with speeds that exceed satellite and dial-up speeds but are less than 4 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload.  Any new services funded in whole or in part by monies from this Initiative shall be capable of being continuously upgraded to reflect the best available, most economically feasible service capabilities.


(b) The Department of Public Service shall publish annually a list of census blocks eligible for funding based on the Department's most recent broadband mapping data.  The Department annually shall solicit proposals from service providers to deploy broadband to eligible census blocks.  The Department shall give priority to proposals that reflect the lowest cost of providing services to unserved and underserved locations;  however, the Department also shall consider:

(1) the proposed data transfer rates and other data transmission characteristics of services that would be available to consumers;


(2) the price to consumers of services;


(3) the proposed cost to consumers of any new construction, equipment installation service, or facility required to obtain service;


(4) whether the proposal would use the best available technology that is economically feasible;


(5) the availability of service of comparable quality and speed;  and


(6) the objectives of the State's Telecommunications Plan.

"Vermont Statutes Title 18. Health, § 9371. Principles for health care reform",https://codes.findlaw.com/vt/title-18-health/vt-st-tit-18-sect-9371.html,"
(1) The state of Vermont must ensure universal access to and coverage for high-quality, medically necessary health services for all Vermonters.  Systemic barriers, such as cost, must not prevent people from accessing necessary health care.  All Vermonters must receive affordable and appropriate health care at the appropriate time in the appropriate setting.


(2) Overall health care costs must be contained and growth in health care spending in Vermont must balance the health care needs of the population with the ability to pay for such care.


(3) The health care system must be transparent in design, efficient in operation, and accountable to the people it serves.  The state must ensure public participation in the design, implementation, evaluation, and accountability mechanisms of the health care system.


(4) Primary care must be preserved and enhanced so that Vermonters have care available to them, preferably within their own communities.  Other aspects of Vermont's health care infrastructure, including the educational and research missions of the state's academic medical center and other postsecondary educational institutions, the nonprofit missions of the community hospitals, and the critical access designation of rural hospitals, must be supported in such a way that all Vermonters, including those in rural areas, have access to necessary health services and that these health services are sustainable.


(5) Every Vermonter should be able to choose his or her health care providers.


(6) Vermonters should be aware of the costs of the health services they receive.  Costs should be transparent and easy to understand.


(7) Individuals have a personal responsibility to maintain their own health and to use health resources wisely, and all individuals should have a financial stake in the health services they receive.


(8) The health care system must recognize the primacy of the relationship between patients and their health care practitioners, respecting the professional judgment of health care practitioners and the informed decisions of patients.


(9) Vermont's health delivery system must seek continuous improvement of health care quality and safety and of the health of the population and promote healthy lifestyles.  The system therefore must be evaluated regularly for improvements in access, quality, and cost containment.


(10) Vermont's health care system must include mechanisms for containing all system costs and eliminating unnecessary expenditures, including by reducing administrative costs and by reducing costs that do not contribute to efficient, high-quality health services or improve health outcomes.  Efforts to reduce overall health care costs should identify sources of excess cost growth.


(11) The financing of health care in Vermont must be sufficient, fair, predictable, transparent, sustainable, and shared equitably.


(12) The system must consider the effects of payment reform on individuals and on health care professionals and suppliers.  It must enable health care professionals to provide, on a solvent basis, effective and efficient health services that are in the public interest.


(13) Vermont's health care system must operate as a partnership between consumers, employers, health care professionals, hospitals, and the state and federal government.


(14) State government must ensure that the health care system satisfies the principles expressed in this section.

section 4302
 of this title.

(a) Upon a date specified in the rules adopted by the Secretary to implement this section, it shall be unlawful for any person to operate an air contaminant source that has allowable emissions of more than 10 tons per year of all contaminants, excluding greenhouse gases, except in compliance with a permit issued by the Secretary under this section.  The Secretary may require that air contaminant sources with allowable emissions of 10 tons or less per year obtain such a permit, upon determining that the toxicity and quantity of hazardous air contaminants emitted may adversely affect susceptible populations, or if deemed appropriate based on an evaluation of the requirements of the federal Clean Air Act.


(b) Any person required by this section to have a permit shall, not later than 12 months after the date on which the source becomes subject to rules adopted by the secretary to implement this section, submit a complete permit application and related materials to the secretary.  The secretary may require any applicant, including a person requesting permission to operate under the terms of a previously issued general permit, to submit any additional information which the secretary considers necessary in order to determine whether the operation of the air contaminant source will be in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and with the rules adopted under this chapter.  The secretary may refuse to grant a permit, or permission to operate under the terms of a general permit, until that information is furnished and evaluated, and until that determination has been made.  If a person submits a timely and complete application for a permit required by this section, but final action has not been taken on that application, the source's failure to have a permit shall not be a violation of this section, unless the delay in final action was due to the failure of the applicant to submit, in a timely manner, information required or requested to process the application.


(c) For air contaminant sources that have allowable emissions of more than 10 tons per year of all contaminants, excluding greenhouse gases, upon making a determination to issue a draft permit, the secretary shall issue a notice that includes a brief description of the source and the address where a complete permit application and a draft permit may be reviewed, shall provide a public comment period on all draft permits, and shall hold a public informational meeting, if requested.  The public comment period on a draft permit for a source that has allowable emissions of more than 10 tons per year, excluding greenhouse gases, shall be 30 days if the source is subject to subchapter V (permits) of 42 U.S.C. chapter 85 (air pollution prevention and control) and shall otherwise be 10 days.  For air contaminant sources that have allowable emissions of less than ten tons per year of all contaminants, the secretary may provide an opportunity for public comment or a public informational hearing, or both, before ruling on a proposed permit.  In determining whether to provide for comment or a meeting, the secretary shall consider the degree of toxicity of the air contaminant and the emission rate, the proximity of the source to residences, population centers and other sensitive human receptors, and emission dispersion characteristics at or near the source.  The secretary shall fully consider all written and oral submissions concerning proposed permits prior to taking final action on those proposed permits.


(d) Each permit issued under this section shall contain such terms and conditions as may be necessary to assure compliance with the requirements of this chapter and applicable rules and shall be issued for a fixed term, not to exceed five years.  In addition, the secretary shall, where necessary, include in a permit issued under this section conditions which revise existing or set new emission control requirements for the source based on, at a minimum, the application of reasonably available control technology.  For any source that, in whole or in part, is not in compliance with all applicable requirements, the permit shall include an appropriate schedule of compliance which is acceptable to the secretary.


(e) A permit issued under this section may be renewed upon application to the secretary for a fixed period of time, not to exceed five years.

(1) A permit being renewed shall be subject to the same procedural requirements, including those for public participation, that apply to initial permit issuance, except that a permit being renewed shall not be subject to the public notice and comment requirements of this chapter if all of the following apply:

(A) The secretary determines that no substantive changes have occurred at the air contaminant source that would affect emissions or require changes to the permit.


(B) The secretary determines no new statutory or regulatory requirements need to be added to the permit.


(C) The air contaminant source does not require a permit under subchapter V (permits) of 42 U.S.C. chapter 85 (air pollution prevention and control).



(2) The secretary shall not issue a permit renewal unless the applicant first demonstrates that the emissions from the subject source meet all applicable emission control requirements or are subject to, and in compliance with, an appropriate schedule of compliance.

(2) The secretary shall not issue a permit renewal unless the applicant first demonstrates that the emissions from the subject source meet all applicable emission control requirements or are subject to, and in compliance with, an appropriate schedule of compliance.


(f) If an application for a permit renewal has been submitted to the Secretary six months prior to the termination of the permit, and any additional information requested by the secretary has been submitted in a timely manner, but the Secretary has failed to issue or deny the renewal permit before the end of the term of the previous permit, the permit shall not expire until the renewal permit has been issued or denied.  In the event of a conflict between this subsection and 
3 V.S.A. § 814(b)
, the provisions of this section shall govern.


(g) The secretary shall have power to suspend, terminate, modify, or revoke for cause and to reissue any permit issued under this section.



(h)(1) The secretary may issue general operating permits covering numerous similar sources.  A general permit shall be adopted as an administrative rule under the provisions of 3 V.S.A. chapter 25.  Each rule creating a general permit shall include provisions that require public notice of the fact that specified emitters have applied for general permits.


(2) Each rule creating a general permit shall provide a process by which interested persons can obtain detailed information about the nature and extent of the activity proposed to receive a general permit, and a process by which aggrieved persons can obtain an opportunity to be heard on a request that the general permit be issued only subject to specific conditions to limit or mitigate the effects of the emissions in question.  Based on information presented at such a hearing, an applicant may be required to obtain a permit other than a general permit, or may obtain a general permit subject to specified conditions.

(i) Failure of the secretary to act on a permit application or a permit renewal application within 18 months after the date of receipt of a completed application shall be treated as a final permit action solely for purposes of obtaining judicial review of such action by the applicant, by any person who participated in the public comment process or by any other adversely affected person in order to compel the secretary to act on such application without additional delay.


(j) Except in compliance with a permit issued by the secretary under this section, it shall be unlawful for a person to operate an air contaminant source that has allowable emissions of greenhouse gases that equal or exceed any threshold established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at or above which such emissions are subject to the requirements of subchapter V (permits) of 42 U.S.C. chapter 85 (air pollution prevention and control).  Based on available emission control technologies or energy efficiency measures, or as otherwise appropriate to implement the provisions of this chapter, the secretary may adopt rules to require air contaminant sources with allowable emissions below such threshold to obtain a permit under this section.

(1)(A) “Appraisal value” shall mean, with respect to property enrolled in a use value appraisal program, the use value appraisal as defined in subdivision 3752(12) of this title, multiplied by the common level of appraisal, and with respect to all other property, except for owner-occupied housing identified in subdivision (C) of this subdivision (1), the estimated fair market value.  The estimated fair market value of a property is the price that the property will bring in the market when offered for sale and purchased by another, taking into consideration all the elements of the availability of the property, its use both potential and prospective, any functional deficiencies, and all other elements such as age and condition which combine to give property a market value.  Those elements shall include the effect of any State or local law or regulation affecting the use of land, including 10 V.S.A. chapter 151 or any land capability plan established in furtherance or implementation thereof, rules adopted by the State Board of Health and any local or regional zoning ordinances or development plans.  In determining estimated fair market value, the sale price of the property in question is one element to consider, but is not solely determinative.


(B) For residential rental property that is subject to a housing subsidy covenant or other legal restriction, imposed by a governmental, quasi-governmental, or public purpose entity, on rents that may be charged, fair market value shall be determined by an income approach using the following elements:

, and 24 CFR Part 882 Subpart D and E, the higher of contract rents (meaning the amount of federal rental assistance plus any tenant contribution) and HUD market rents;


(ii) actual expenses incurred with respect to the property which shall be provided by the property owner in a format acceptable to the Commissioner and certified by an independent third party, such as a certified public accounting firm or public or quasi-public funding agency;


(iii) a vacancy rate that is 50 percent of the market vacancy rate as determined by the United States Census Bureau with local review by the Vermont Housing Finance Agency;  and


(iv) a capitalization rate that is typical for the geographic area determined and published annually prior to April 1 by the Division of Property Valuation and Review after consultation with the Vermont Housing Finance Agency.



(C) For owner-occupied housing that is subject to a housing subsidy covenant, as defined in 
27 V.S.A. § 610
, imposed by a governmental, quasi-governmental, or public purpose entity, that limits the price for which the property may be sold, the housing subsidy covenant shall be deemed to cause a material decrease in the value of the owner-occupied housing, and the appraisal value means not less than 60 and not more than 70 percent of what the fair market value of the property would be if it were not subject to the housing subsidy covenant.  Every five years, starting in 2019, the Commissioner of Taxes, in consultation with the Vermont Housing Conservation Board, shall report to the General Assembly on whether the percentage of appraised valued used in this subdivision should be altered, and the reasons for his or her determination.



(D)(i) For real and personal property comprising a renewable energy plant generating electricity from solar power, except land and property that is exempt under subdivision 3802(17) of this title, the appraisal value shall be determined by an income capitalization or discounted cash flow approach that includes the following:

(IV) for the purposes of calculating appraisal value for net metered systems receiving a credit specified in 
30 V.S.A. § 219a (h)(1)(k)
, the model used to calculate value will not incorporate a factor for electricity rate escalation;  and


(V) for plants operating as a net-metered system as described in 
30 V.S.A. § 219a
 with a capacity of 50 kW or greater, the plant capacity used to determine value in the model shall be reduced by 50 kW and the appraisal value shall be calculated only on additional capacity in excess of 50 kW.



(ii) The owner of a project shall respond to a request for information from the municipal assessing officials by returning the information sheet describing the project in the form specified by the Director not later than 45 days after the request for information is sent to the owner.  If the owner does not provide a complete and timely response, the municipality shall determine the appraisal value using the published model and the best estimates of the inputs to the model available to the municipality at the time, and the provisions of 
section 4006
 of this title shall apply to the information form in the same manner as if the information form were an inventory as described in that section.  Nothing in this subdivision (1)(D) shall affect the availability of the exemption set forth in the provisions of

(a) The General Assembly hereby adopts the “Bill of Rights for Hospital Patients” as follows:

(1) The patient has the right to considerate and respectful care at all times and under all circumstances with recognition of his or her personal dignity.


(2) The patient shall have an attending physician who is responsible for coordinating a patient's care.


(3) The patient has the right to obtain, from the physician coordinating his or her care, complete and current information concerning diagnosis, treatment, and any known prognosis in terms the patient can reasonably be expected to understand.  If the patient consents or if the patient is incompetent or unable to understand, immediate family members, a reciprocal beneficiary, or a guardian may also obtain this information.  The patient has the right to know by name the attending physician primarily responsible for coordinating his or her care.


(4) Except in emergencies, the patient has the right to receive from the patient's physician information necessary to give informed consent prior to the start of any procedure or treatment, or both.  Such information for informed consent should include but not necessarily be limited to the specific procedure or treatment, or both, the medically significant risks involved, and the probable duration of incapacitation.  Where medically significant alternatives for care or treatment exist, or when the patient requests information concerning medical alternatives, the patient has the right to such information.  The patient also has the right to know the name of the person responsible for the procedures or treatment, or both.

(6) whether the establishment of an additional new motor vehicle dealer would increase competition, and therefore be in the public interest;  and


(7) the effect that the proposed franchise would have on the stability of existing franchisees in the same line-make in the relevant market area.

(b) Any person required by this section to have a permit shall, not later than 12 months after the date on which the source becomes subject to rules adopted by the secretary to implement this section, submit a complete permit application and related materials to the secretary.  The secretary may require any applicant, including a person requesting permission to operate under the terms of a previously issued general permit, to submit any additional information which the secretary considers necessary in order to determine whether the operation of the air contaminant source will be in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and with the rules adopted under this chapter.  The secretary may refuse to grant a permit, or permission to operate under the terms of a general permit, until that information is furnished and evaluated, and until that determination has been made.  If a person submits a timely and complete application for a permit required by this section, but final action has not been taken on that application, the source's failure to have a permit shall not be a violation of this section, unless the delay in final action was due to the failure of the applicant to submit, in a timely manner, information required or requested to process the application.


(c) When an application is filed under this section, the Secretary shall proceed in accordance with chapter 170 of this title.


(d) Each permit issued under this section shall contain such terms and conditions as may be necessary to assure compliance with the requirements of this chapter and applicable rules and shall be issued for a fixed term, not to exceed five years.  In addition, the secretary shall, where necessary, include in a permit issued under this section conditions which revise existing or set new emission control requirements for the source based on, at a minimum, the application of reasonably available control technology.  For any source that, in whole or in part, is not in compliance with all applicable requirements, the permit shall include an appropriate schedule of compliance which is acceptable to the secretary.


(e) A person may renew a permit issued under this section upon application to the Secretary for a fixed period of time, not to exceed five years.   The Secretary shall not issue a permit renewal unless the applicant first demonstrates that the emissions from the subject source meet all applicable emission control requirements or are subject to, and in compliance with, an appropriate schedule of compliance.


(f) If an application for a permit renewal has been submitted to the Secretary six months prior to the termination of the permit, and any additional information requested by the secretary has been submitted in a timely manner, but the Secretary has failed to issue or deny the renewal permit before the end of the term of the previous permit, the permit shall not expire until the renewal permit has been issued or denied.  In the event of a conflict between this subsection and 
3 V.S.A. § 814(b)
, the provisions of this section shall govern.


(g) The secretary shall have power to suspend, terminate, modify, or revoke for cause and to reissue any permit issued under this section.

section 9439
 of this title, within such time limits as the Board shall establish by rule, the application will be deemed inactive unless the applicant, within six months, requests in writing that the application be reactivated and the Board grants the request.  If an applicant fails to respond to an information request within 12 months or, in the case of review cycle applications under 
section 9439
 of this title, within such time limits as the Board shall establish by rule, the application will become invalid unless the applicant requests, and the Board grants, an extension.

"Vermont Statutes Title 24. Municipal and County Government, § 4414. Zoning;  permissible types of regulations",https://codes.findlaw.com/vt/title-24-municipal-and-county-government/vt-st-tit-24-sect-4414.html,"
(1) Zoning districts.  A municipality may define different and separate zoning districts, and identify within these districts which land uses are permitted as of right, and which are conditional uses requiring review and approval, including the districts set forth in this subdivision (1).

(A) Downtown, village center, new town center, and growth center districts.  The definition or purpose stated for local downtown, village center, new town center, or growth center zoning districts should conform with the applicable definitions in 
section 2791
 of this title.  Municipalities may adopt downtown, village center, new town center, or growth center districts without seeking state designation under chapter 76A of this title.  A municipality may adopt a manual of graphic or written design guidelines to assist applicants in the preparation of development applications.  The following objectives should guide the establishment of boundaries, requirements, and review standards for these districts:

(i) To create a compact settlement oriented toward pedestrian activity and including an identifiable neighborhood center, with consistently higher densities than those found in surrounding districts.


(ii) To provide for a variety of housing types, jobs, shopping, services, and public facilities with residences, shops, workplaces, and public buildings interwoven within the district, all within close proximity.


(iii) To create a pattern of interconnecting streets and blocks, consistent with historic settlement patterns, that encourages multiple routes from origins to destinations.


(iv) To provide for a coordinated transportation system with a hierarchy of appropriately designed facilities for pedestrians, bicycles, public transit, and automotive vehicles.


(v) To provide for natural features and undisturbed areas that are incorporated into the open space of the neighborhood as well as historically compatible squares, greens, landscaped streets, and parks woven into the pattern of the neighborhood.


(vi) To provide for public buildings, open spaces, and other visual features that act as landmarks, symbols, and focal points for community identity.


(vii) To ensure compatibility of buildings and other improvements as determined by their arrangement, building bulk, form, design, character, and landscaping to establish a livable, harmonious, and diverse environment.


(viii) To provide for public and private buildings that form a consistent, distinct edge, are oriented toward streets, and define the border between the public street space and the private block interior.



(B) Agricultural, rural residential, forest, and recreational districts.  Where, for the purposes set forth in 
section 4302
 of this title, it is deemed necessary to safeguard certain areas from urban or suburban development and to encourage that development in other areas of the municipality or region, the following districts may be created:

(i) Agricultural or rural residential districts, permitting all types of agricultural uses and prohibiting all other land development except low density residential development.


(ii) Forest districts, permitting commercial forestry and related uses and prohibiting all other land development.


(iii) Recreational districts, permitting camps, ski areas, and related recreational facilities, including lodging for transients and seasonal residents, and prohibiting all other land development except construction of residences for occupancy by caretakers and their families.



(C) Airport hazard area.  In accordance with 5 V.S.A. chapter 17, any municipality may adopt special bylaws governing the use of land, location, and size of buildings and density of population within a distance of two miles from the boundaries of an airport under an approach zone and for a distance of one mile from the boundaries of the airport elsewhere.  The designation of that area and the bylaws applying within that area shall be in accord with applicable airport zoning guidelines, if any, adopted by the Vermont Transportation Board.


(D) Shorelands.

(i) A municipality may adopt bylaws to regulate shorelands as defined in 
10 V.S.A. § 1422
 to prevent and control water pollution;  preserve and protect wetlands and other terrestrial and aquatic wildlife habitat;  conserve the scenic beauty of shorelands;  minimize shoreline erosion;  reserve public access to public waters;  and achieve other municipal, regional, or State shoreland conservation and development objectives.


(ii) Shoreland bylaws may regulate the design and maintenance of sanitary facilities;  regulate filling of and other adverse alterations to wetlands and other wildlife habitat areas;  control building location;  require the provision and maintenance of vegetation;  require provisions for access to public waters for all residents and owners of the development;  and impose other requirements authorized by this chapter.



(E) Design review districts.  Bylaws may contain provisions for the establishment of design review districts.  Prior to the establishment of such a district, the planning commission shall prepare a report describing the particular planning and design problems of the proposed district and setting forth a design plan for the areas which shall include recommended planning and design criteria to guide future development.  The planning commission shall hold a public hearing, after public notice, on that report.  After this hearing, the planning commission may recommend to the legislative body a design review district as a bylaw amendment.  A design review district may be created for any area containing structures of historical, architectural, or cultural merit, and other areas in which there is a concentration of community interest and participation such as a central business district, civic center, or a similar grouping or focus of activities.  These areas may include townscape areas that resemble in important aspects the earliest permanent settlements, including a concentrated urban settlement with striking vistas, views extending across open fields and up to the forest edge, a central focal point and town green, and buildings of high architectural quality, including styles of the early 19th century.  Within such a designated design review district, no structure may be erected, reconstructed, substantially altered, restored, moved, demolished, or changed in use or type of occupancy without approval of the plans by the appropriate municipal panel.  A design review board may be appointed by the legislative body of the municipality, in accordance with 
section 4433
 of this title, to advise any appropriate municipal panel.

(i) Bylaws may contain provisions for the establishment of historic districts and the designation of historic landmarks.  Historic districts shall include structures and areas of historic or architectural significance and may include distinctive design or landscape characteristics, areas, and structures with a particular relationship to the historic and cultural values of the surrounding area, and structures whose exterior architectural features bear a significant relationship to the remainder of the structures or to the surrounding area.  Bylaws may reference National and State Registers of Historic Places, properties, and districts.  A report prepared under 
section 4441
 of this title with respect to the establishment of a local historic district or designation of an historic landmark shall contain a map that clearly delineates the boundaries of the local historic district or landmark, justification for the boundary, a description of the elements of the resources that are integral to its historical, architectural, and cultural significance, and a statement of the significance of the local historic district or landmark.


(ii) With respect to external appearances and other than normal maintenance, no structure within a designated historic district may be rehabilitated, substantially altered, restored, moved, demolished, or changed, and no new structure within an historic district may be erected without approval of the plans therefor by the appropriate municipal panel.  The panel shall consider the following in its review of plans submitted:

(I) The historic or architectural significance of the structure, its distinctive characteristics, and its relationship to the historic significance of the surrounding area.


(II) The relationship of the proposed changes in the exterior architectural features of the structure to the remainder of the structure and to the surrounding area.


(III) The general compatibility of the proposed exterior design, arrangement, texture, and materials proposed to be used.


(IV) Any other factors, including the environmental setting and aesthetic factors that the panel deems to be pertinent.



(iii) When an appropriate municipal panel is reviewing an application relating to an historic district, the panel:

(I) Shall be strict in its judgment of plans for those structures deemed to be valuable under subdivision (1)(F)(i) of this section, but is not required to limit new construction, alteration, or repairs to the architectural style of any one period, but may encourage compatible new design.


(II) If an application is submitted for the alteration of the exterior appearance of a structure or for the moving or demolition of a structure deemed to be significant under subdivision (1)(F)(i) of this section, shall meet with the owner of the structure to devise an economically feasible plan for the preservation of the structure.


(III) Shall approve an application only when the panel is satisfied that the proposed plan will not materially impair the historic or architectural significance of the structure or surrounding area.


(IV) In the case of a structure deemed to be significant under subdivision (1)(F)(i) of this section, may approve the proposed alteration despite subdivision (1)(F)(ii)(III) of this section if the panel finds either or both of the following:

(aa) The structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program that will be of clear and substantial benefit to the municipality.


(bb) Retention of the structure would cause undue financial hardship to the owner.




(iv) This subdivision (1)(F), and bylaws issued pursuant to it, shall apply to designation of individual landmarks as well as to designation of local historic districts.  A landmark is any individual building, structure, or site that by itself has a special historic, architectural, or cultural value.


(v) The provisions of this subdivision (1)(F) shall not in any way apply to or affect buildings, structures, or land within the “Capitol complex,” as defined in 29 V.S.A. chapter 6.



(G) River corridors and buffers.  In accordance with 
section 4424
 of this title, a municipality may adopt bylaws to protect river corridors and buffers, as those terms are defined in
