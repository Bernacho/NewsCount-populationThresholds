(a) As soon as possible after receipt of federal decennial census information, the council of any city which elects the members of its governing board on a district basis, or where candidates for such office must reside in a district in order to run, shall evaluate the existing district boundaries to determine whether it would be lawful to hold the next election without revising districts to correct population imbalances.  If such revision is necessary, the council shall consider whether it will be possible to adopt the changes (and obtain approval from the United States Department of Justice, if necessary) before the third day before opening of the filing period for the municipal election.  The council shall take into consideration the time that will be required to afford ample opportunities for public input.  If the council determines that it most likely will not be possible to adopt the changes (and obtain federal approval, if necessary) before the third business day before opening of the filing period, and determines further that the population imbalances are so significant that it would not be lawful to hold the next election using the current electoral districts, it may adopt a resolution delaying the election so that it will be held on the timetable provided by subsection (d) of this section.  Before adopting such a resolution, the council shall hold a public hearing on it.  The notice of public hearing shall summarize the proposed resolution and shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation, not less than seven days before the date fixed for the hearing.  Notwithstanding adoption of such a resolution, if the council proceeds to adopt the changes, (and federal approval is obtained, if necessary) by the end of the third business day before the opening of the filing period, the election shall be held on the regular schedule under the revised electoral districts.  Any resolution adopted under this subsection, and any changes in electoral district boundaries made under this section shall be submitted to the United States Department of Justice (if the city is covered under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965), the State Board of Elections, and to the board conducting the elections for that city.


(b) In adopting any revisal under this section, if the council determines that in order for the plan to conform to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the number of district seats needs to be increased or decreased, it may do so by following the procedures set forth in Part 4 of Article 5 of Chapter 160A of the General Statutes, except that the ordinance under 
G.S. 160A-102
 may be adopted at the same meeting as the public hearing, and any referendum on the change under 
G.S. 160A-103
 shall not apply to the municipal election in the two years following a federal decennial census.


(c) If the resolution provided for in subsection (a) of this section is not adopted and:

(1) Proposed changes to the electoral districts are not adopted, or


(2) Such changes are adopted, but approval under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, is required, and notice of such approval is not received, 

by the end of the third business day before the opening of the filing period, the election shall be held on the regular schedule using the current electoral districts.

(3) Contracting with another unit of local government for the provision of inspection services pursuant to Part 1 of Article 20 of Chapter 160A.

Such action shall be taken no later than the applicable date in the schedule below, according to the county's population as published in the 1970 United States Census:
Counties over 75,000 population -- July 1, 1979
Counties between 50,001 and 75,000 -- July 1, 1981
Counties between 25,001 and 50,000 -- July 1, 1983
Counties 25,000 and under -- July 1, 1985.
In the event that any county shall fail to provide inspection services by the date specified above or shall cease to provide such services at any time thereafter, the Commissioner of Insurance shall arrange for the provision of such services, either through personnel employed by his Department or through an arrangement with other units of government.  In either event, the Commissioner shall have and may exercise within the county's jurisdiction all powers made available to the board of county commissioners with respect to building inspection under Part 4 of Article 18 of this Chapter and Part 1 of Article 20 of Chapter 160A.  Whenever the Commissioner has intervened in this manner, the county may assume provision of inspection services only after giving the Commissioner two years' written notice of its intention to do so;  provided, however, that the Commissioner may waive this requirement or permit assumption at an earlier date if he finds that such earlier assumption will not unduly interfere with arrangements he has made for the provision of those services.


(1) Creating its own inspection department;


(2) Creating a joint inspection department in cooperation with one or more other units of local government, pursuant to 
G.S. 153A-353

(3) Contracting with another unit of local government for the provision of inspection services pursuant to Part 1 of Article 20 of Chapter 160A.


(b) No person may perform electrical inspections pursuant to this Part unless he has been certified as qualified by the Commissioner of Insurance.  To be certified a person must pass a written examination based on the electrical regulations included in the latest edition of the State Building Code as filed with the Secretary of State.  The examination shall be under the supervision of and conducted according to rules and regulations prescribed by the Chief State Electrical Inspector or Engineer of the State Department of Insurance and the Board of Examiners of Electrical Contractors.  It shall be held quarterly, in Raleigh or any other place designated by the Chief State Electrical Inspector or Engineer.
The rules and regulations may provide for the certification of class I, class II, and class III inspectors, according to the results of the examination.  The examination shall be based on the type and character of electrical installations being made in the territory in which the applicant wishes to serve as an electrical inspector.  A class I inspector may serve anywhere in the State, but class II and class III inspectors shall be limited to service in the territory for which they have qualified.
The Commissioner of Insurance shall issue a certificate to each person who passes the examination, approving the person for service in a designated territory.  To remain valid, a certificate must be renewed each January by payment of an annual renewal fee of one dollar ($1.00).  The examination fee shall be five dollars ($5.00).
If the person appointed by a county as electrical inspector fails to pass the examination, the county shall continue to make appointments until an appointee has passed the examination.  For the interim the Commissioner of Insurance may authorize the county to use a temporary inspector.
The provisions of this subsection shall become void and ineffective on such date as the North Carolina Code Officials Qualification Board certifies to the Secretary of State that it has placed in effect a certification system for electrical inspectors pursuant to its authority granted by Article 9C of Chapter 143 of the General Statutes.

(1) If the Local Government Commission certifies the estimate, the municipality is not required to annex the area and no petition to annex the area may be submitted under subsection (b1) of this section for 36 months following the certification.  During the 36-month period, the municipality shall make ongoing, annual good faith efforts to secure Community Development Block Grants or other grant funding for extending water and sewer service to all parcels in the areas covered by the petition.  If sufficient funding is secured so that the estimated capital cost to the municipality for extending water and sewer service, less the funds secured, would result in an annual debt service payment cost to the municipality of less than five percent (5%) of the municipality's annual water and sewer systems revenue for the most recent fiscal year, then the governing body shall within 30 days adopt an annexation ordinance for the area with an effective date no later than 24 months after the adoption of the ordinance.

G.S. 160A-58.10

(g) The governing board may initiate annexation of contiguous property owned by the municipality by adopting a resolution stating its intent to annex the property, in lieu of filing a petition.  The resolution shall contain an adequate description of the property, state that the property is contiguous to the municipal boundaries and fix a date for a public hearing on the question of annexation.  Notice of the public hearing shall be published as provided in subsection (c) of this section.  The governing board may hold the public hearing and adopt the annexation ordinance as provided in subsection (d) of this section.

(3) When they are lawfully shot under laws and rules pertaining to the destruction of animals committing depredations to property.


(d) Foxes may not be taken with the aid of any electronic calling device.


(e) The Wildlife Resources Commission is directed to improve its capabilities for studying fox and fur-bearer populations generally and, on the basis of its present knowledge and future studies, to implement management methods and impose controls designed to produce optimum fox and fur-bearer populations in the various areas of the State.


(f) If, on the basis of its studies and other information available, the Wildlife Resources Commission determines the population of foxes in an area is fully adequate to support a harvesting of that population, the Wildlife Resources Commission may, upon passage of local legislation permitting same, open a season for taking foxes by trapping.  When the season is open for trapping, foxes may also be taken by the use of methods lawful for taking game animals, including the use of firearms.  Any bag, possession, or season limits imposed on foxes taken from the area in question will apply in the aggregate to all foxes killed without regard to the method of taking.


(f1) In those counties in which open seasons for taking foxes with weapons and by trapping were established between June 18, 1982, and July 1, 1987, in accordance with the procedure then set forth in subsection (f) of this section, the Wildlife Resources Commission is authorized to continue such seasons from year to year so long as the fox populations of such counties remain adequate to support the resulting harvest.  The counties referred to in this subsection are as follows:  Caswell, Clay, Graham, Henderson, Hyde, Macon, and Tyrrell.


(g) The Wildlife Resources Commission may provide for the sale of foxes lawfully taken in areas of open season as provided in subsection (f), under a system providing strict controls.  The Wildlife Resources Commission must implement a system of tagging foxes and fox furs with a special fox tag, and the Commission may charge two dollars and twenty-five cents ($2.25) for each tag furnished to hunters, trappers, and fur dealers.  The fox tag or tags must be procured before taking foxes by any method designed to kill foxes or when the intent is to harvest foxes.  The number of tags furnished to any individual may be limited as to area and as to number in accordance with area, bag, possession, or season limits that may be imposed on foxes.  No person may continue to hunt or trap foxes under this fox harvesting provision unless he still has at least one valid unused fox tag lawful for use in the area in question.  A person hunting foxes with dogs not intending to kill them need not have any fox tag, but any fox accidentally killed by that hunter must be disposed of without sale as provided below, and no foxes not tagged may be sold.  The Wildlife Resources Commission may by rule provide reporting and controlled-disposition requirements, not including sale, of foxes killed accidentally by dog hunters, motor vehicles, and in other situations;  it may also impose strict controls on the disposition of foxes taken by owners of property under the laws and rules relating to depredations, and authorize sale under controlled conditions of foxes taken under depredation permits.


(h) In any area of the State in which the Wildlife Resources Commission determines that hunting of foxes with dogs has an appreciably harmful effect upon turkey restoration projects, it may declare a closed season for an appropriate length of time upon the taking with dogs of all species of wild animals and birds.  Except as otherwise provided in 
G.S. 113-291.1(d)
 or 
(d1)
, this subsection does not prohibit lawful field trials or the training of dogs.


(i) Upon notification by the State Health Director of the presence of a contagious animal disease in a local fox population, the Commission is authorized to establish such population control measures as are appropriate until notified by public health authorities that the problem is deemed to have passed.


(j) The Wildlife Resources Commission shall prohibit the use of dogs in hunting foxes during the period from March 15 through July 15 in Bladen Lakes State Forest Game Land.

North Carolina General Statutes Chapter 105. Taxation § 105-472. Disposition and distribution of taxes collected,https://codes.findlaw.com/nc/chapter-105-taxation/nc-gen-st-sect-105-472.html,"
(a) County Allocation. -- The Secretary shall, on a monthly basis, allocate to each taxing county for which the Secretary collects the tax the net proceeds of the tax collected in that county under this Article.  For the purpose of this section, “net proceeds” means the gross proceeds of the tax collected in each county under this Article less taxes refunded, the cost to the State of collecting and administering the tax in the county as determined by the Secretary, and other deductions that may be charged to the county.  If the Secretary collects local sales or use taxes in a month and the taxes cannot be identified as being attributable to a particular taxing county, the Secretary shall allocate the taxes among the taxing counties in proportion to the amount of taxes collected in each county under this Article during that month and shall include them in the monthly distribution.  Amounts collected by electronic funds transfer payments are included in the distribution for the month in which the return that applies to the payment is received.


(b) Distribution Between Counties and Cities. -- The Secretary shall divide the amount allocated to each taxing county among the county and its municipalities in accordance with the method determined by the county.  The board of county commissioners shall, by resolution, choose one of the following methods of distribution:

(1) Per Capita Method. -- The net proceeds of the tax collected in a taxing county shall be distributed to that county and to the municipalities in the county on a per capita basis according to the total population of the taxing county, plus the total population of the municipalities in the county.  In the case of a municipality located in more than one county, only that part of its population living in the taxing county is considered its “total population”.  In order to make the distribution, the Secretary shall determine a per capita figure by dividing the amount allocated to each taxing county by the total population of that county plus the total population of all municipalities in the county.  The Secretary shall then multiply this per capita figure by the population of the taxing county and by the population of each municipality in the county;  each respective product shall be the amount to be distributed to the county and to each municipality in the county.  To determine the population of each county and each municipality, the Secretary shall use the most recent annual estimate of population certified by the State Budget Officer.


(2) Ad Valorem Method. -- The net proceeds of the tax collected in a taxing county shall be distributed to that county and the municipalities in the county in proportion to the total amount of ad valorem taxes levied by each on property having a tax situs in the taxing county during the fiscal year next preceding the distribution.  For purposes of this section, the amount of the ad valorem taxes levied by a county or municipality includes ad valorem taxes levied by the county or municipality in behalf of a taxing district and collected by the county or municipality.  In addition, the amount of taxes levied by a county includes ad valorem taxes levied by a merged school administrative unit described in 
G.S. 115C-513
 in the part of the unit located in the county.  In computing the amount of tax proceeds to be distributed to each county and municipality, the amount of any ad valorem taxes levied but not substantially collected shall be ignored.  Each county and municipality receiving a distribution of the proceeds of the tax levied under this Article shall in turn immediately share the proceeds with each district in behalf of which the county or municipality levied ad valorem taxes in the proportion that the district levy bears to the total levy of the county or municipality.  Any county or municipality that fails to provide the Department of Revenue with information concerning ad valorem taxes levied by it adequate to permit a timely determination of its appropriate share of tax proceeds collected under this Article may be excluded by the Secretary from each monthly distribution with respect to which the information was not provided in a timely manner, and those tax proceeds shall then be distributed only to the remaining counties or municipalities, as appropriate.  For the purpose of computing the distribution of the tax under this subsection to any county and the municipalities located in the county for any month with respect to which the property valuation of a public service company is the subject of an appeal and the Department of Revenue is restrained by law from certifying the valuation to the county and the municipalities in the county, the Department shall use the last property valuation of the public service company that has been certified.

The board of county commissioners in each taxing county shall, by resolution adopted during the month of April of each year, determine which of the two foregoing methods of distribution shall be in effect in the county during the next succeeding fiscal year.  In order for the resolution to be effective, a certified copy of it must be delivered to the Secretary in Raleigh within 15 calendar days after its adoption.  If the board fails to adopt a resolution choosing a method of distribution not then in effect in the county, or if a certified copy of the resolution is not timely delivered to the Secretary, the method of distribution then in effect in the county shall continue in effect for the following fiscal year.  The method of distribution in effect on the first of July of each fiscal year shall apply to every distribution made during that fiscal year.


(1) Per Capita Method. -- The net proceeds of the tax collected in a taxing county shall be distributed to that county and to the municipalities in the county on a per capita basis according to the total population of the taxing county, plus the total population of the municipalities in the county.  In the case of a municipality located in more than one county, only that part of its population living in the taxing county is considered its “total population”.  In order to make the distribution, the Secretary shall determine a per capita figure by dividing the amount allocated to each taxing county by the total population of that county plus the total population of all municipalities in the county.  The Secretary shall then multiply this per capita figure by the population of the taxing county and by the population of each municipality in the county;  each respective product shall be the amount to be distributed to the county and to each municipality in the county.  To determine the population of each county and each municipality, the Secretary shall use the most recent annual estimate of population certified by the State Budget Officer.


(2) Ad Valorem Method. -- The net proceeds of the tax collected in a taxing county shall be distributed to that county and the municipalities in the county in proportion to the total amount of ad valorem taxes levied by each on property having a tax situs in the taxing county during the fiscal year next preceding the distribution.  For purposes of this section, the amount of the ad valorem taxes levied by a county or municipality includes ad valorem taxes levied by the county or municipality in behalf of a taxing district and collected by the county or municipality.  In addition, the amount of taxes levied by a county includes ad valorem taxes levied by a merged school administrative unit described in 
G.S. 115C-513
 in the part of the unit located in the county.  In computing the amount of tax proceeds to be distributed to each county and municipality, the amount of any ad valorem taxes levied but not substantially collected shall be ignored.  Each county and municipality receiving a distribution of the proceeds of the tax levied under this Article shall in turn immediately share the proceeds with each district in behalf of which the county or municipality levied ad valorem taxes in the proportion that the district levy bears to the total levy of the county or municipality.  Any county or municipality that fails to provide the Department of Revenue with information concerning ad valorem taxes levied by it adequate to permit a timely determination of its appropriate share of tax proceeds collected under this Article may be excluded by the Secretary from each monthly distribution with respect to which the information was not provided in a timely manner, and those tax proceeds shall then be distributed only to the remaining counties or municipalities, as appropriate.  For the purpose of computing the distribution of the tax under this subsection to any county and the municipalities located in the county for any month with respect to which the property valuation of a public service company is the subject of an appeal and the Department of Revenue is restrained by law from certifying the valuation to the county and the municipalities in the county, the Department shall use the last property valuation of the public service company that has been certified.

"North Carolina General Statutes Chapter 143. State Departments, Institutions, and Commissions § 143-215.112. Local air pollution control programs",https://codes.findlaw.com/nc/chapter-143-state-departments-institutions-and-commissions/nc-gen-st-sect-143-215-112.html,"
(a) The Commission is authorized and directed to review and have general oversight and supervision over all local air pollution control programs and to this end shall review and certify such programs as being adequate to meet the requirements of this Article and Article 21 of this Chapter and any applicable standards and rules adopted pursuant thereto.  The Commission shall certify any local program which:

(1) Provides by ordinance or local law for requirements compatible with those imposed by the provisions of this Article and Article 21 of this Chapter, and the standards and rules issued pursuant thereto;  provided, however, the Commission upon request of a municipality or other local unit may grant special permission for the governing body of such unit to adopt a particular class of air contaminant regulations which would result in more effective air pollution control than applicable standards or rules promulgated by the Commission;


(2) Provides for the adequate enforcement of such requirements by appropriate administrative and judicial process;


(3) Provides for an adequate administrative organization, staff, financial and other resources necessary to effectively and efficiently carry out its programs;  and


(4) Is approved by the Commission as adequate to meet the requirements of this Article and any applicable rules pursuant thereto.



(1) Provides by ordinance or local law for requirements compatible with those imposed by the provisions of this Article and Article 21 of this Chapter, and the standards and rules issued pursuant thereto;  provided, however, the Commission upon request of a municipality or other local unit may grant special permission for the governing body of such unit to adopt a particular class of air contaminant regulations which would result in more effective air pollution control than applicable standards or rules promulgated by the Commission;


(2) Provides for the adequate enforcement of such requirements by appropriate administrative and judicial process;


(3) Provides for an adequate administrative organization, staff, financial and other resources necessary to effectively and efficiently carry out its programs;  and


(4) Is approved by the Commission as adequate to meet the requirements of this Article and any applicable rules pursuant thereto.


(b) No municipality, county, local board or commission or group of municipalities and counties may establish and administer an air pollution control program unless such program meets the requirements of this section and is so certified by the Commission.



(c)(1) The governing body of any county, municipality, or group of counties and municipalities within a designated area of the State, as defined in this Article and Article 21, subject to the approval of the Commission, is hereby authorized to establish, administer, and enforce a local air pollution control program for the county, municipality, or designated area of the State which includes but is not limited to:

a. Development of a comprehensive plan for the control and abatement of new and existing sources of air pollution;


b. Air quality monitoring to determine existing air quality and to define problem areas, as well as to provide background data to show the effectiveness of a pollution abatement program;


c. An emissions inventory to identify specific sources of air contamination and the contaminants emitted, together with the quantity of material discharged into the outdoor atmosphere;


d. Adoption, after notice and public hearing, of air quality and emission control standards, or adoption by reference, without public hearing, of any applicable rules and standards duly adopted by the Commission;  and administration of such rules and standards in accordance with provisions of this section.


e. Provisions for the establishment or approval of time schedules for the control or abatement of existing sources of air pollution and for the review of plans and specifications and issuance of approval documents covering the construction and operation of pollution abatement facilities at existing or new sources;


f. Provision for adequate administrative staff, including an air pollution control officer and technical personnel, and provision for laboratory and other necessary facilities.



(2) Subject to the approval of the Commission as provided in this Article and Article 21, the governing body of any county or municipality may establish, administer, and enforce an air pollution control program by any of the following methods:

a. Establishing a program under the administration of the duly elected governing body of the county or municipality.


b. Appointing an air pollution control board consisting of not less than five nor more than seven members who shall serve for terms of six years each and until their successors are appointed and qualified.  Two members shall be appointed for two-year terms, two shall be appointed for four-year terms, and the remaining member or members shall be appointed for six-year terms.  Where the term “governing body” is referred to in this section, it shall include the air pollution control board.  Such board shall have all the powers and authorities granted to any local air pollution control program.  The board shall elect a chairman and shall meet at least quarterly or upon the call of the chairman or any two members of the board.


c. Appointing an air pollution control board as provided in this subdivision, and by appropriate written agreement designating the local health department or other department of county or municipal government as the administrative agent for the air pollution control board.


d. Designating, by appropriate written agreement, the local board of health and the local health department as the air pollution control board and agency.

North Carolina General Statutes Chapter 105. Taxation § 105-164.44I. Distribution of part of sales tax on video programming service and telecommunications service to counties and cities,https://codes.findlaw.com/nc/chapter-105-taxation/nc-gen-st-sect-105-164-44i.html,"
(a) Distribution.--The Secretary must distribute to the counties and cities part of the taxes imposed by 
G.S. 105-164.4(a)(4c)
 on telecommunications service and 
G.S. 105-164.4(a)(6)
 on video programming service.  The Secretary must make the distribution within 75 days after the end of each calendar quarter.  The amount the Secretary must distribute is the sum of the revenue listed in this subsection.  From this amount, the Secretary must first make the distribution required by subsection (b) of this section and then distribute the remainder in accordance with subsections (c) and (d) of this section.  The revenue to be distributed under this section consists of the following:

(1) The amount specified in 
G.S. 105-164.44F(a)(2)
.


(2) Twenty three and six tenths percent (23.6%) of the net proceeds of the taxes collected during the quarter on video programming, other than on direct-to-home satellite service.


(3) Thirty-seven and one tenths percent (37.1%) of the net proceeds of the taxes collected during the quarter on direct-to-home satellite service.



(1) The amount specified in 
G.S. 105-164.44F(a)(2)
.


(2) Twenty three and six tenths percent (23.6%) of the net proceeds of the taxes collected during the quarter on video programming, other than on direct-to-home satellite service.


(3) Thirty-seven and one tenths percent (37.1%) of the net proceeds of the taxes collected during the quarter on direct-to-home satellite service.


(b) Supplemental PEG Channel Support.--
G.S. 105-164.44J
 sets out the requirements for receipt by a county or city of supplemental PEG channel support funds distributed under this subsection.  The Secretary must include the applicable amount of supplemental PEG channel support in each quarterly distribution to a county or city.  The amount to include is one-fourth of the share of each qualifying PEG channel certified by the city or county under 
G.S. 105-164.44J
.  The share of each certified PEG channel is the sum of four million dollars ($4,000,000) and the amount of any funds returned to the Secretary in the prior fiscal year under 
G.S. 105-164.44J(d)
 divided by the number of PEG channels certified under G.S. 105-164.44J.A county or city may not receive PEG channel support under this subsection for more than three qualifying PEG channels.
For purposes of this subsection, the term “qualifying PEG channel” has the same meaning as in 
G.S. 105-164.44J
.


(c) 2006-2007 Fiscal Year Distribution. -- The share of a county or city is its proportionate share of the amount to be distributed to all counties and cities under this subsection.  The proportionate share of a county or city is the base amount for the county or city compared to the base amount for all other counties and cities.  The base amount of a county or city that did not impose a cable franchise tax under 
G.S. 153A-154
 or 
G.S. 160A-214
 before July 1, 2006, is two dollars ($2.00) times the most recent annual population estimate for that county or city.  The base amount of a county or city that imposed a cable franchise tax under either 
G.S. 153A-154
 or 
G.S. 160A-214
 before July 1, 2006, is the amount of cable franchise tax and subscriber fee revenue the county or city certifies to the Secretary that it imposed during the first six months of the 2006-2007 fiscal year.  A county or city must make this certification by March 15, 2007.  The certification must specify the amount of revenue that is derived from the cable franchise tax and the amount that is derived from the subscriber fee.


(c1) Revised Certification.--If a county or city determines that the amount of cable franchise tax it imposed during the first six months of the 2006-2007 fiscal year differs from the amount certified to the Secretary under subsection (c) of this section, the county or city may submit a new certification to the Secretary revising the amount.  For distributions for quarters beginning on or after October 1, 2007, the Secretary must determine the proportionate share of a county or city based upon certifications submitted on or before October 1, 2007.  For distributions for quarters beginning on or after April 1, 2008, the Secretary must determine the proportionate share of a county or city based upon certifications submitted on or before April 1, 2008.  Certifications submitted after April 1, 2008, may not be used to adjust a county's or city's base amount under subsection (c) of this section.


(d) Subsequent Distributions. -- For subsequent fiscal years, the Secretary must multiply the amount of a county's or city's share under this section for the preceding fiscal year by the percentage change in its population for that fiscal year and add the result to the county's or city's share for the preceding fiscal year to obtain the county's or city's adjusted amount.  Each county's or city's proportionate share for that year is its adjusted amount compared to the sum of the adjusted amounts for all counties and cities.


(e) Use of Proceeds.--A county or city that imposed subscriber fees during the first six months of the 2006-2007 fiscal year must use a portion of the funds distributed to it each fiscal year under subsections (c) and (d) of this section for the operation and support of PEG channels.  The amount of funds that must be used for PEG channel operation and support in fiscal year 2006-2007 is two times the amount of subscriber fee revenue the county or city certified to the Secretary that it imposed during the first six months of the 2006-2007 fiscal year.  The amount of funds that must be used for PEG channel operation and support in subsequent fiscal years is the same proportionate amount of the funds that were distributed under subsections (c) and (d) of this section and used for this purpose in fiscal year 2006-2007. 
A county or city that used part of its franchise tax revenue in fiscal year 2005-2006 for the operation and support of PEG channels or a publicly owned and operated television station must use the funds distributed to it under subsections (c) and (d) of this section to continue the same level of support for the PEG channels and public stations.  The remainder of the distribution may be used for any public purpose.


(f) Late Information. -- A county or city that does not submit information that the Secretary needs to make a distribution by the date the information is due is excluded from the distribution.  If the county or city later submits the required information, the Secretary must include the county or city in the distribution for the quarter that begins after the date the information is received.


(g) Population Determination. -- In making population determinations under this section, the Secretary must use the most recent annual population estimates certified to the Secretary by the State Budget Officer.  For purposes of the distributions made under this section, the population of a county is the population of its unincorporated areas plus the population of an ineligible city in the county, as determined under this section.


(h) City Changes. -- The following changes apply when a city alters its corporate structure or incorporates:

(1) If a city dissolves and is no longer incorporated, the proportional shares of the remaining counties and cities must be recalculated to adjust for the dissolution of that city.


(2) If two or more cities merge or otherwise consolidate, their proportional shares are combined.


(3) If a city divides into two or more cities, the proportional share of the city that divides is allocated among the new cities on a per capita basis.


(4) If a city incorporates after January 1, 2007, and the incorporation is not addressed by subdivisions (2) or (3) of this subsection, the share of the county in which the new city is located is allocated between the county and the new city on a per capita basis.



(1) If a city dissolves and is no longer incorporated, the proportional shares of the remaining counties and cities must be recalculated to adjust for the dissolution of that city.


(2) If two or more cities merge or otherwise consolidate, their proportional shares are combined.


(3) If a city divides into two or more cities, the proportional share of the city that divides is allocated among the new cities on a per capita basis.


(4) If a city incorporates after January 1, 2007, and the incorporation is not addressed by subdivisions (2) or (3) of this subsection, the share of the county in which the new city is located is allocated between the county and the new city on a per capita basis.


(i) Ineligible Cities. -- An ineligible city is disregarded for all purposes under this section.  A city incorporated on or after January 1, 2000, is not eligible for a distribution under this section unless it meets both of the following requirements:

(1) It is eligible to receive funds under 
G.S. 136-41.2
.


(2) A majority of the mileage of its streets is open to the public.



(1) It is eligible to receive funds under 
G.S. 136-41.2
.


(2) A majority of the mileage of its streets is open to the public.


(j) Nature. -- The General Assembly finds that the revenue distributed under this section is local revenue, not a State expenditure, for the purpose of 
Section 5(3) of Article III of the North Carolina Constitution
.  Therefore, the Governor may not reduce or withhold the distribution.

(a) There is established the Elderly and Disabled Transportation Assistance Program that shall provide State financed elderly and disabled transportation services for counties within the State.  The Department of Transportation is designated as the agency of the State responsible for administering State funds appropriated to purchase elderly and disabled transportation services for counties within the State.  The Department shall develop appropriate procedures regarding the distribution and use of these funds and shall adopt rules to implement these procedures.  No funds appropriated pursuant to this act may be used to cover State administration costs.


(b) For the purposes of this section, an elderly person is defined as one who has reached the age of 60 or more years, and a disabled person is defined as one who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, an individual who has a record of such impairment, or an individual who is regarded as having such an impairment.  Certification of eligibility shall be the responsibility of the county.


(c) All funds distributed by the Department under this section are intended to purchase additional transportation services, not to replace funds now being used by local governments for that purpose.  These funds are not to be used towards the purchase of transportation vehicles or equipment.  To this end, only those counties maintaining elderly and disabled transportation services at a level consistent with those in place on January 1, 1987, shall be eligible for additional transportation assistance funds.


(d) The Public Transportation Division of the Department of Transportation shall distribute these funds to the counties according to the following formula:  fifty percent (50%) divided equally among all counties;  twenty-two and one-half percent (22  1/2 %) based upon the number of elderly residents per county as a percentage of the State's elderly population;  twenty-two and one-half percent (22  1/2 %) based upon the number of disabled residents per county as a percentage of the State's disabled population;  and, the remaining five percent (5%) based upon a population density factor that recognizes the higher transportation costs in sparsely populated counties.


(e) Funds distributed by the Department under this section shall be used by counties, public transportation authorities, or regional public transportation authorities in a manner consistent with transportation development plans which have been approved by the Department and the Board of County Commissioners.  To receive funds apportioned for a given fiscal year, a county shall have an approved transportation development plan.  Funds that are not obligated in a given fiscal year due to the lack of such a plan will be distributed to the eligible counties based upon the distribution formula prescribed by subsection (d) of this section.


(f) A regional public transportation authority created pursuant to Article 25 or Article 26 of Chapter 160A of the General Statutes may, upon written agreement with the municipalities served by a public transportation authority or counties served by the regional public transportation authority, apply for and receive any funds to which the member municipality or counties are entitled to receive based on the distribution formula set out in subsection (d) of this section.

North Carolina General Statutes Chapter 162A. Water and Sewer Systems § 162A-21. Preamble,https://codes.findlaw.com/nc/chapter-162a-water-and-sewer-systems/nc-gen-st-sect-162a-21.html,"
(1) The existing pattern of public water supply development in North Carolina is dominated by many small systems serving few customers.  Of the 1,782 public water systems of record on July 1, 1970, according to Department of Health and Human Services statistics, over eighty percent (80%) were serving less than 1,000 people each.  These small systems are often underfinanced, inadequately designed and maintained, difficult to coordinate with nearby regional systems, and generally inferior to systems serving larger communities as regards adequacy of source, facilities and quality.  The situation which has developed reflects a need for better planning at both State and local levels.


(2) The State's population balance is steadily changing.  Sparsely populated counties are losing residents to the more densely populated counties, while the State's total population is increasing.  As this trend continues, small towns and communities will find it increasingly difficult to build and maintain public water supply systems.  Also, as urban centers expand, and embrace relatively large geographical areas, economic factors will dictate that regional water systems be developed to serve these centers and to meet the demands of commercial and industrial development.  It is estimated that countywide or regional water systems are needed now by 50 counties.


(3) If the future public water supply needs of the State are to be met, a change in the existing pattern of public water supply development and management must be undertaken.  Regional planning and development is an immediate need.  The creation of countywide or regional water supplies, with adequate interconnections, is necessary in order to provide an adequate supply of high quality water to the State's citizens, to make supplies less vulnerable to recurring drought conditions, and to have systems large enough to justify the costs of adequate facilities and of proper operation and maintenance.


(4) The State should provide a framework for comprehensive planning of regional water supply systems, and for the orderly coordination of local actions, so as to make the most efficient use of available water resources and economies of scale for construction, operation and maintenance.  The State should also provide financial assistance to local governments and regional authorities in order to assist with the cost of developing comprehensive regional plans, and countywide plans compatible with a regional system.

It shall be the duty of the mayor of each municipality to report to the Department of Transportation such information as it may request for its guidance in determining the eligibility of each municipality to receive funds under this section and in determining the amount of allocation to which each is entitled.  Upon failure of any municipality to make such report within the time prescribed by the Department of Transportation, the Department of Transportation may disregard such defaulting unit in making said allotment.
The funds to be allocated under this section shall be paid in cash to the various eligible municipalities on or before October 1 and January 1 of each year as provided in this section.  Provided that eligible municipalities are authorized within the discretion of their governing bodies to enter into contracts for the purpose of maintenance, repair, construction, reconstruction, widening, or improving streets of such municipalities at any time after January 1 of any calendar year in total amounts not to exceed ninety percent (90%) of the amount received by such municipality during the preceding fiscal year, in anticipation of the receipt of funds under this section during the next fiscal year, to be paid for out of such funds when received.
The Department of Transportation may withhold each year an amount not to exceed one percent (1%) of the total amount appropriated for distribution under this section for the purpose of correcting errors in allocations:  Provided, that the amount so withheld and not used for correcting errors will be carried over and added to the amount to be allocated for the following year.
The word “street” as used in this section is hereby defined as any public road maintained by a municipality and open to use by the general public, and having an average width of not less than 16 feet.  In order to obtain the necessary information to distribute the funds herein allocated, the Department of Transportation may require that each municipality eligible to receive funds under this section submit to it a statement, certified by a registered engineer or surveyor of the total number of miles of streets in such municipality.  The Department of Transportation may in its discretion require the certification of mileage on a biennial basis.


(b) For purposes of this section and of 
G.S. 136-41.2
 and 
136-41.3
, urban service districts defined by the governing board of a consolidated city-county in which street services are provided by the consolidated city-county, as defined by 
G.S. 160B-2(1)
, shall be considered eligible municipalities, and the allocations to be made thereby shall be made to the government of the consolidated city-county.


(c) Any funds allocated to the unincorporated area known as the Butner Reservation shall be transferred to the Town of Butner.


(d) Nature. - The General Assembly finds that the revenue distributed under this section is local revenue, not a State expenditure, for the purpose of 
Section 5(3) of Article III of the North Carolina Constitution
.  Therefore, the Governor may not reduce or withhold the distribution.

(a) Distribution.--The Insurance Commissioner shall deduct the sum of three percent (3%) from the tax proceeds credited to the Department pursuant to 
G.S. 105-228.5(d)(3)
 and pay the same over to the treasurer of the North Carolina State Firefighters' Association for administrative purposes.  The Insurance Commissioner shall deduct the sum of two percent (2%) from the tax proceeds and retain the same in the budget of the Department of Insurance for the purpose of administering the disbursement of funds by the board of trustees in accordance with the provisions of 
G.S. 58-84-35
.  The Insurance Commissioner shall, pursuant to 
G.S. 58-84-50
, credit the amount forfeited by nonmember fire districts to the North Carolina State Firefighters' Association.  The Insurance Commissioner shall distribute the remaining tax proceeds to the treasurer of each fire district as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.


(b) Allocation to Counties.--The Insurance Commissioner shall allocate to each county an amount of tax proceeds based upon the amount allocated to it in the previous year.  If the amount allocable in the current year is less than the amount allocated in the previous year, then the Commissioner shall reduce the amount allocated to each county.  The amount of the reduction is equal to the difference in the amount allocated in the previous year and the amount allocable in the current year multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the population of the county and the denominator of which is the population of the State.  If the amount allocable in the current year is greater than the amount allocated in the previous year, then the Commissioner shall increase the amount allocated to each county.  The amount of the increase is equal to the excess proceeds multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the population of the county and the denominator of which is the population of the State.


(c) Distribution to Fire Districts.--Once the Insurance Commissioner has allocated the tax proceeds to a county under subsection (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall distribute those allocations directly to the fire districts in that county.  The Commissioner shall distribute the allocations by electronic funds transfer, unless a fire district's account cannot accept electronic funds transfers, in which case the Commissioner shall distribute the district's allocation by paper check.  The amount distributed to each fire district is equal to the total amount allocated to the county multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the tax value of the property located in the fire district and the denominator of which is the tax value of all property located in any fire district in that county.  A county shall provide the Commissioner with the tax value of property located in each fire district in that county by February 1 of each year.  If a county does not submit information that the Commissioner needs to make a distribution by the date the information is due, the Commissioner shall distribute the allocation based on the most recent information the Commissioner has.


(c1) Certain Amounts Redistributed.--Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this section, the Insurance Commissioner shall not distribute funds to a fire district whose local relief fund's balance exceeds the amount provided under 
G.S. 58-84-33(a)
.  Instead, the Commissioner shall, using the methodology provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, distribute those funds to the fire districts whose local relief funds' balances do not exceed the amount provided under 
G.S. 58-84-33(a)
.  If all of a county's fire districts' local relief funds' balances exceed the amount provided under 
G.S. 58-84-33(a)
, then the Commissioner shall reallocate the amount the county would have received to the counties with fire districts that do not exceed the amount provided under 
G.S. 58-84-33(a)
.


(d) Administration.--These funds shall be held by the treasurer of a fire district as a separate and distinct fund.  The fire district shall immediately pay the funds to the treasurer of the local board of trustees upon the treasurer's election and qualification, for the use of the board of trustees of the local Firefighters' Relief Fund in each fire district to be used by it for the purposes provided in 
G.S. 58-84-35

North Carolina General Statutes Chapter 105. Taxation § 105-164.44F. Distribution of part of telecommunications taxes to cities,https://codes.findlaw.com/nc/chapter-105-taxation/nc-gen-st-sect-105-164-44f.html,"
(a) Amount.--The Secretary must distribute part of the taxes imposed by 
G.S. 105-164.4(a)(4c)
 on telecommunications service and ancillary service.  The Secretary must make the distribution within 75 days after the end of each calendar quarter.  The amount the Secretary must distribute is the following percentages of the net proceeds of the taxes collected during the quarter:

(1) Eighteen and seventy one hundredths percent (18.70%) minus two million six hundred twenty thousand nine hundred forty-eight dollars ($2,620,948), must be distributed to cities in accordance with this section.  The deduction is one-fourth of the annual amount by which the distribution to cities of the gross receipts franchise tax on telephone companies, imposed by former G.S. 105-20, was required to be reduced beginning in fiscal year 1995-96 as a result of the “freeze deduction.”


(2) Seven and seven tenths percent (7.7%) must be distributed to counties and cities as provided in 
G.S. 105-164.44I
.



(1) Eighteen and seventy one hundredths percent (18.70%) minus two million six hundred twenty thousand nine hundred forty-eight dollars ($2,620,948), must be distributed to cities in accordance with this section.  The deduction is one-fourth of the annual amount by which the distribution to cities of the gross receipts franchise tax on telephone companies, imposed by former G.S. 105-20, was required to be reduced beginning in fiscal year 1995-96 as a result of the “freeze deduction.”


(2) Seven and seven tenths percent (7.7%) must be distributed to counties and cities as provided in 
G.S. 105-164.44I
.


(b) Share of Cities Incorporated on or After January 1, 2001. -- The share of a city incorporated on or after January 1, 2001, is its per capita share of the amount to be distributed to all cities incorporated on or after this date.  This amount is the proportion of the total to be distributed under this section that is the same as the proportion of the population of cities incorporated on or after January 1, 2001, compared to the population of all cities.  In making the distribution under this subsection, the Secretary must use the most recent annual population estimates certified to the Secretary by the State Budget Officer.


(c) Share of Cities Incorporated Before January 1, 2001. -- The share of a city incorporated before January 1, 2001, is its proportionate share of the amount to be distributed to all cities incorporated before this date.  A city's proportionate share for a quarter is based on the amount of telephone gross receipts franchise taxes attributed to the city under 
G.S. 105-116.1
 for the same quarter that was the last quarter in which taxes were imposed on telephone companies under repealed 
G.S. 105-120
.  The amount to be distributed to all cities incorporated before January 1, 2001, is the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section, minus the amount distributed under subsection (b) of this section.
The following changes apply when a city incorporated before January 1, 2001, alters its corporate structure.  When a change described in subdivision (2) or (3) occurs, the resulting cities are considered to be cities incorporated before January 1, 2001, and the distribution method set out in this subsection rather than the method set out in subsection (b) of this section applies:

(1) If a city dissolves and is no longer incorporated, the proportional shares of the remaining cities incorporated before January 1, 2001, must be recalculated to adjust for the dissolution of that city.


(2) If two or more cities merge or otherwise consolidate, their proportional shares are combined.


(3) If a city divides into two or more cities, the proportional share of the city that divides is allocated among the new cities on a per capita basis.



(1) If a city dissolves and is no longer incorporated, the proportional shares of the remaining cities incorporated before January 1, 2001, must be recalculated to adjust for the dissolution of that city.


(2) If two or more cities merge or otherwise consolidate, their proportional shares are combined.


(3) If a city divides into two or more cities, the proportional share of the city that divides is allocated among the new cities on a per capita basis.


(d) Share of Cities Served by a Telephone Membership Corporation. -- The share of a city served by a telephone membership corporation, as described in Chapter 117 of the General Statutes, is computed as if the city was incorporated on or after January 1, 2001, under subsection (b) of this section.  If a city is served by a telephone membership corporation and another provider, then its per capita share under this subsection applies only to the population of the area served by the telephone membership corporation.


(e) Ineligible Cities. -- An ineligible city is disregarded for all purposes under this section.  A city incorporated on or after January 1, 2000, is not eligible for a distribution under this section unless it meets both of the following requirements:

(1) It is eligible to receive funds under 
G.S. 136-41.2
.


(2) A majority of the mileage of its streets is open to the public.



(1) It is eligible to receive funds under 
G.S. 136-41.2
.


(2) A majority of the mileage of its streets is open to the public.


(f) Nature. -- The General Assembly finds that the revenue distributed under this section is local revenue, not a State expenditure, for the purpose of 
Section 5(3) of Article III of the North Carolina Constitution
.   Therefore, the Governor may not reduce or withhold the distribution.

(1) Prescribed burning reduces the naturally occurring buildup of vegetative fuels on forestlands, thereby reducing the risk and severity of wildfires and lessening the loss of life and property.


(2) The State's ever-increasing population is resulting in urban development directly adjacent to fire-prone forestlands, referred to as a woodland-urban interface area.  The use of prescribed burning in these woodland-urban interface areas substantially reduces the risk of wildfires that cause damage.


(3) Many of North Carolina's natural ecosystems require periodic fire for their survival.  Prescribed burning is essential to the perpetuation, restoration, and management of many plant and animal communities.  Prescribed burning benefits game, nongame, and endangered wildlife species by increasing the growth and yield of plants that provide forage and an area for escape and brooding and that satisfy other habitat needs.


(4) Forestlands are economic, biological, and aesthetic resources of statewide significance.  In addition to reducing the frequency and severity of wildfires, prescribed burning of forestlands helps to prepare sites for replanting and natural seeding, to control insects and diseases, and to increase productivity.


(5) Prescribed burning enhances the resources on public use lands, such as State and national forests, wildlife refuges, nature preserves, and game lands.  Prescribed burning enhances private lands that are managed for wildlife refuges, nature preserves, and game lands.  Prescribed burning enhances private lands that are managed for wildlife, recreation, and other purposes.

(2) Risks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums.  Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans which establish standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions, or both.  Those standards may measure any differences among risks that have probable effect upon losses or expenses.  Classifications or modifications of classifications of risks may be established based upon size, expense, management, individual experience, location or dispersion of hazard, or any other reasonable considerations.  Those classifications and modifications shall apply to all risks under the same or substantially the same circumstances or conditions.


(3) The expense provisions included in the rates to be used by an insurer may reflect the operating methods of the insurer and, as far as it is credible, its own expense experience.


(4) In the case of property insurance rates under this Article, consideration shall be given to the insurance public protection classifications of fire districts established by the Commissioner.  The Commissioner shall establish and modify from time to time insurance public protection districts for all rural areas of the State and for cities with populations of 100,000 or fewer, according to the most recent annual population estimates certified by the State Budget Officer.  In establishing and modifying these districts, the Commissioner shall use standards at least equivalent to those used by the Insurance Services Office, Inc., or any successor organization.  The standards developed by the Commissioner are subject to Article 2A of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes.  The insurance public protection classifications established by the Commissioner issued pursuant to the provisions of this Article shall be subject to appeal as provided in

S.L. 2012-142, § 13.4(a), eff. July 1, 2012
.


(g) Vision and Mission Statements.--The Secretary shall develop a vision statement for economic development that would describe the preferred future for North Carolina and what North Carolina would be like if all economic development efforts were successful.  The Secretary shall then develop a mission statement that outlines the basic purpose of each of North Carolina's economic development programs.  Because special purpose nonprofit organizations are uniquely situated to conduct the entrepreneurial and high-risk activity of investing in and supporting new business creation in the State, they should be assigned a dominant role in this key component of economic development activity.


(h) Goals and Objectives.--The Secretary, using data from the public input and the environmental scan, shall formulate a list of goals and objectives.  Goals shall be long-range, four years or more, and shall address both needs of economically distressed Regions and counties as well as opportunities for Regions and counties not distressed.  The goals shall be developed with realism but should also be selected so as to encourage every Region and county within the State to develop to its maximum potential.  Objectives shall be one year or less in scope and shall, if achieved, lead to the realization of the goals formulated by the Secretary as provided in this section.
Both goals and objectives should be stated largely in economic terms, that is, they should be related to specific population, employment, demographic targets, or economic sector targets.  Both efficiency and equity considerations are to be addressed and balanced with special emphasis placed on the needs of disadvantaged or economically distressed populations and communities.  The goals and objectives should not state how the economic targets are to be reached, but rather what the economic conditions will be if they are obtained.  So that the progress of North Carolina's economic development efforts can be monitored, the Secretary shall set objectives for each goal that allow measurement of progress toward the goal.  Objectives should be quantifiable and time-specific in order to serve as performance indicators.


(i) Formulation of Economic Development Strategy.--The Plan shall have as its action component a strategy set forth in a blueprint for directing resources of time and dollars toward the satisfaction of the goals and objectives stated in subsection (h) of this section.  As a practical consequence of the economic environment, a focus on the competitiveness of indigenous industries and entrepreneurial development is required.  The Plan shall include a strategy for the coordination of initiatives and activities for workforce preparedness, funded by federal or State sources, including, but not limited to, vocational education, applied technology education, remedial education, and job training, and the achievement of the economic development goals of the Plan.  A balance of opportunity between rural and urban regions and between majority and minority populations should be an overriding consideration.  Equity of opportunity for counties and communities across the State will involve the explicit consideration of local fiscal capacity and the fiscal ability to support development activities.
The concept of differentiation should be employed.  The Plan should recognize the various strengths and weaknesses of the State and its component regions, subregions, and, in some cases, individual counties.  The concept of market segmentation should be employed.  Different Regions and subregions of the State should be promoted to different markets.


(j) Implementation Plan.--Based upon all of the foregoing steps, the Secretary shall establish an implementation plan assigning to the appropriate parties specific responsibilities for meeting measurable objectives.  The implementation plan shall contain all necessary elements so that it may be used as a means to monitor performance, guide appropriations, and evaluate the outcomes of the parties involved in economic development in the State.


(k) Annual Evaluation.--The Secretary shall annually evaluate the State's economic performance based upon the statistics listed in this subsection and upon the Secretary's stated goals and objectives in its Plan.  The statistics upon which the evaluation is made should be available to policymakers.  The information may be provided in whatever format and through whatever means is most efficient.

(a) All of the powers granted by this Article may be exercised by any city within its corporate limits.  In addition, any city may exercise these powers within a defined area extending not more than one mile beyond its limits.  With the approval of the board or boards of county commissioners with jurisdiction over the area, a city of 10,000 or more population but less than 25,000 may exercise these powers over an area extending not more than two miles beyond its limits and a city of 25,000 or more population may exercise these powers over an area extending not more than three miles beyond its limits.  The boundaries of the city's extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be the same for all powers conferred in this Article.  No city may exercise extraterritorially any power conferred by this Article that it is not exercising within its corporate limits.  In determining the population of a city for the purposes of this Article, the city council and the board of county commissioners may use the most recent annual estimate of population as certified by the Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Administration.


(a1) Any municipality planning to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction under this Article shall notify the owners of all parcels of land proposed for addition to the area of extraterritorial jurisdiction, as shown on the county tax records.  The notice shall be sent by first-class mail to the last addresses listed for affected property owners in the county tax records.  The notice shall inform the landowner of the effect of the extension of extraterritorial jurisdiction, of the landowner's right to participate in a public hearing prior to adoption of any ordinance extending the area of extraterritorial jurisdiction, as provided in 
G.S. 160A-364
, and the right of all residents of the area to apply to the board of county commissioners to serve as a representative on the planning board and the board of adjustment, as provided in 
G.S. 160A-362
.  The notice shall be mailed at least four weeks prior to the public hearing.  The person or persons mailing the notices shall certify to the city council that the notices were sent by first-class mail, and the certificate shall be deemed conclusive in the absence of fraud.


(b) Any council wishing to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction under this Article shall adopt, and may amend from time to time, an ordinance specifying the areas to be included based upon existing or projected urban development and areas of critical concern to the city, as evidenced by officially adopted plans for its development.  Boundaries shall be defined, to the extent feasible, in terms of geographical features identifiable on the ground.  A council may, in its discretion, exclude from its extraterritorial jurisdiction areas lying in another county, areas separated from the city by barriers to urban growth, or areas whose projected development will have minimal impact on the city.  The boundaries specified in the ordinance shall at all times be drawn on a map, set forth in a written description, or shown by a combination of these techniques.  This delineation shall be maintained in the manner provided in 
G.S. 160A-22
 for the delineation of the corporate limits, and shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of each county in which any portion of the area lies.


(c) Where the extraterritorial jurisdiction of two or more cities overlaps, the jurisdictional boundary between them shall be a line connecting the midway points of the overlapping area unless the city councils agree to another boundary line within the overlapping area based upon existing or projected patterns of development.


(d) If a city fails to adopt an ordinance specifying the boundaries of its extraterritorial jurisdiction, the county of which it is a part shall be authorized to exercise the powers granted by this Article in any area beyond the city's corporate limits.  The county may also, on request of the city council, exercise any or all these powers in any or all areas lying within the city's corporate limits or within the city's specified area of extraterritorial jurisdiction.


(e) No city may hereafter extend its extraterritorial powers under this Article into any area for which the county at that time has adopted and is enforcing a zoning ordinance and subdivision regulations and within which it is enforcing the State Building Code.  However, the city may do so where the county is not exercising all three of these powers, or when the city and the county have agreed upon the area within which each will exercise the powers conferred by this Article.


(f) When a city annexes, or a new city is incorporated in, or a city extends its jurisdiction to include, an area that is currently being regulated by the county, the county regulations and powers of enforcement shall remain in effect until (i) the city has adopted such regulations, or (ii) a period of 60 days has elapsed following the annexation, extension or incorporation, whichever is sooner.  During this period the city may hold hearings and take any other measures that may be required in order to adopt its regulations for the area.


(f1) When a city relinquishes jurisdiction over an area that it is regulating under this Article to a county, the city regulations and powers of enforcement shall remain in effect until (i) the county has adopted this regulation or (ii) a period of 60 days has elapsed following the action by which the city relinquished jurisdiction, whichever is sooner.  During this period the county may hold hearings and take other measures that may be required in order to adopt its regulations for the area.


(g) When a local government is granted powers by this section subject to the request, approval, or agreement of another local government, the request, approval, or agreement shall be evidenced by a formally adopted resolution of that government's legislative body.  Any such request, approval, or agreement can be rescinded upon two years' written notice to the other legislative bodies concerned by repealing the resolution.  The resolution may be modified at any time by mutual agreement of the legislative bodies concerned.


(h) Nothing in this section shall repeal, modify, or amend any local act which defines the boundaries of a city's extraterritorial jurisdiction by metes and bounds or courses and distances.


(i) Whenever a city or county, pursuant to this section, acquires jurisdiction over a territory that theretofore has been subject to the jurisdiction of another local government, any person who has acquired vested rights under a permit, certificate, or other evidence of compliance issued by the local government surrendering jurisdiction may exercise those rights as if no change of jurisdiction had occurred.  The city or county acquiring jurisdiction may take any action regarding such a permit, certificate, or other evidence of compliance that could have been taken by the local government surrendering jurisdiction pursuant to its ordinances and regulations.  Except as provided in this subsection, any building, structure, or other land use in a territory over which a city or county has acquired jurisdiction is subject to the ordinances and regulations of the city or county.


(j) Repealed by Session Laws 1973, c. 669, § 1.


(k) As used in this subsection, “bona fide farm purposes” is as described in 
G.S. 153A-340
.  As used in this subsection, “property” means a single tract of property or an identifiable portion of a single tract.  Property that is located in the geographic area of a municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction and that is used for bona fide farm purposes is exempt from exercise of the municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction under this Article.  Property that is located in the geographic area of a municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction and that ceases to be used for bona fide farm purposes shall become subject to exercise of the municipality's extraterritorial jurisdiction under this Article.  For purposes of complying with 44 C.F.R. Part 60, Subpart A, property that is exempt from the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to the county's floodplain ordinance or all floodplain regulation provisions of the county's unified development ordinance.


(l) A municipality may provide in its zoning ordinance that an accessory building of a “bona fide farm” as defined by 
G.S. 153A-340(b)
 has the same exemption from the building code as it would have under county zoning as provided by Part 3 of Article 18 of Chapter 153A of the General Statutes.

(b) Medical Necessity. - An insurer that limits its health benefit plan coverage to medically necessary services and supplies shall define “medically necessary services or supplies” in its health benefit plan as those covered services or supplies that are:

(1) Provided for the diagnosis, treatment, cure, or relief of a health condition, illness, injury, or disease;  and, except as allowed under

G.S. 58-3-223
, unless contracting health care providers able to meet health needs of the insured are reasonably available to the insured without unreasonable delay.


(e) Nondiscrimination Against High-Risk Populations.--No insurer shall establish provider selection or contract renewal standards or procedures that are designed to avoid or otherwise have the effect of avoiding enrolling high-risk populations by excluding providers because they are located in geographic areas that contain high-risk populations or because they treat or specialize in treating populations that present a risk of higher-than-average claims or health care services utilization.  This subsection does not prohibit an insurer from declining to select a provider or from not renewing a contract with a provider who fails to meet the insurer's selection criteria.

North Carolina General Statutes Chapter 153A. Counties § 153A-274.1. Flood control activities under stormwater management programs,https://codes.findlaw.com/nc/chapter-153a-counties/nc-gen-st-sect-153a-274-1.html,"
(a) Findings.--The General Assembly finds that it is in the best interest of the residents of North Carolina to promote and fund the implementation of stormwater management programs to control and manage water quantity and flow in order to reduce the chances of loss of life and damage to property due to flooding.  The General Assembly also finds that a county has an integral role in furthering this public purpose by promoting and funding implementation of stormwater management programs within the county's territorial jurisdiction to reduce reliance on emergency response services, to reduce negative financial impacts on the community and the public from flooding, including the cost of public infrastructure repairs, to decrease the number of flood-prone homes and businesses, to increase infiltration of stormwater into the ground, and to reduce pollutants from entering the streams.


(b) Scope.--For purposes of operating a public enterprise under this Article, a county is authorized to do any of the following activities within its stormwater management program:

(1) Purchase property for the purpose of demolishing flood-prone buildings.


(2) Implement flood damage reduction techniques that result in improvements to private property in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, to include:

a. Elevating structures or their associated components.


b. Demolishing flood-prone structures.


c. Retrofitting flood-prone structures.




(1) Purchase property for the purpose of demolishing flood-prone buildings.


(2) Implement flood damage reduction techniques that result in improvements to private property in accordance with subsection (c) of this section, to include:

a. Elevating structures or their associated components.


b. Demolishing flood-prone structures.


c. Retrofitting flood-prone structures.



a. Elevating structures or their associated components.


b. Demolishing flood-prone structures.


c. Retrofitting flood-prone structures.


(c) Policy Document.--The county may engage in the activities listed in subdivision (2) of subsection (b) of this section only under the circumstances contained in a policy document approved by the board of county commissioners.  The policy document shall, at a minimum, establish, and may elaborate on, the following:

(1) Private property owner's written consent must be obtained prior to implementation of flood reduction improvements on the owner's property.

(1) That the financing of health care, particularly the reimbursement of health services rendered by health service facilities, limits the effect of free market competition and government regulation is therefore necessary to control costs, utilization, and distribution of new health service facilities and the bed complements of these health service facilities.


(2) That the increasing cost of health care services offered through health service facilities threatens the health and welfare of the citizens of this State in that citizens need assurance of economical and readily available health care.


(3) That, if left to the market place to allocate health service facilities and health care services, geographical maldistribution of these facilities and services would occur and, further, less than equal access to all population groups, especially those that have traditionally been medically underserved, would result.


(3a) That access to health care services and health care facilities is critical to the welfare of rural North Carolinians, and to the continued viability of rural communities, and that the needs of rural North Carolinians should be considered in the certificate of need review process.


(4) That the proliferation of unnecessary health service facilities results in costly duplication and underuse of facilities, with the availability of excess capacity leading to unnecessary use of expensive resources and overutilization of health care services.


(5) Repealed by Laws 1987, c. 511, § 1.


(6) That excess capacity of health service facilities places an enormous economic burden on the public who pay for the construction and operation of these facilities as patients, health insurance subscribers, health plan contributors, and taxpayers.


(7) That the general welfare and protection of lives, health, and property of the people of this State require that new institutional health services to be offered within this State be subject to review and evaluation as to need, cost of service, accessibility to services, quality of care, feasibility, and other criteria as determined by provisions of this Article or by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to provisions of this Article prior to such services being offered or developed in order that only appropriate and needed institutional health services are made available in the area to be served.


(8) That because persons who have received exemptions under Section 11.9(a) of S.L. 2000-67, as amended, and under Section 11.69(b) of S.L. 1997-443, as amended by Section 12.16C(a) of S.L. 1998-212, and as amended by Section 1 of S.L. 1999-135, have had sufficient time to complete development plans and initiate construction of beds in adult care homes.


(9) That because with the enactment of this legislation, beds allowed under the exemptions noted above and pending development will count in the inventory of adult care home beds available to provide care to residents in the State Medical Facilities Plan.


(10) That because State and county expenditures provide support for nearly three-quarters of the residents in adult care homes through the State County Special Assistance program, and excess bed capacity increases costs per resident day, it is in the public interest to promote efficiencies in delivering care in those facilities by controlling and directing their growth in an effort to prevent underutilization and higher costs and provide appropriate geographical distribution.


(11) That physicians providing gastrointestinal endoscopy services in unlicensed settings should be given an opportunity to obtain a license to provide those services to ensure the safety of patients and the provision of quality care.


(12) That demand for gastrointestinal endoscopy services is increasing at a substantially faster rate than the general population given the procedure is recognized as a highly effective means to diagnose and prevent cancer.

(d) With an approving vote of the people, any county may levy property taxes for any purpose for which the county is authorized by law to appropriate money.  Any property tax levy approved by a vote of the people shall not be counted for purposes of the rate limitation imposed in subsection (c).
The county commissioners may call a referendum on approval of a property tax levy.  The referendum may be held at the same time as any other referendum or election, but may not be otherwise held within the period of time beginning 30 days before and ending 10 days after any other referendum or election to be held in the county and already validly called or scheduled by law at the time the tax referendum is called.  The referendum shall be conducted by the county board of elections.  The clerk to the board of commissioners shall publish a notice of the referendum at least twice.  The first publication shall be not less than 14 days and the second publication not less than seven days before the last day on which voters may register for the referendum.  The notice shall state the date of the referendum, the purpose for which it is being held, and a statement as to the last day for registration for the referendum under the election laws then in effect.
The proposition submitted to the voters shall be substantially in one of the following forms:

(1) Shall __________ County be authorized to levy annually a property tax at a rate not in excess of __________ cents on the one hundred dollars ($100.00) value of property subject to taxation for the purpose of __________?


(2) Shall __________ County be authorized to levy annually a property tax at a rate not in excess of that which will produce $__________ for the purpose of __________?


(3) Shall __________ County be authorized to levy annually a property tax without restriction as to rate or amount for the purpose of __________?

If a majority of those participating in the referendum approve the proposition, the board of commissioners may proceed to levy annually a property tax within the limitations (if any) described in the proposition.
The board of elections shall canvass the referendum and certify the results to the board of commissioners.  The board of commissioners shall then certify and declare the result of the referendum and shall publish a statement of the result once, with the following statement appended:  “Any action or proceeding challenging the regularity or validity of this tax referendum must be begun within 30 days after (date of publication).”  The statement of results shall be filed in the clerk's office and inserted in the minutes of the board.
Any action or proceeding in any court challenging the regularity or validity of a tax referendum must be begun within 30 days after the publication of the results of the referendum.  After the expiration of this period of limitation, no right of action or defense based upon the invalidity of or any irregularity in the referendum shall be asserted, nor shall the validity of the referendum be open to question in any court upon any ground whatever, except in an action or proceeding begun within the period of limitation prescribed herein.
Except for supplemental school taxes and except for tax referendums on functions not included in subsection (c) of this section, any referendum held before July 1, 1973, on the levy of property taxes is not valid for the purposes of this subsection.  Counties in which such referendums have been held may support programs formerly supported by voted property taxes within the general rate limitation set out in subsection (c) at any appropriate level and are not subject to the former voted rate limitation.


(1) Shall __________ County be authorized to levy annually a property tax at a rate not in excess of __________ cents on the one hundred dollars ($100.00) value of property subject to taxation for the purpose of __________?


(2) Shall __________ County be authorized to levy annually a property tax at a rate not in excess of that which will produce $__________ for the purpose of __________?


(3) Shall __________ County be authorized to levy annually a property tax without restriction as to rate or amount for the purpose of __________?


(e) With an approving vote of the people, any county may increase the property tax rate limitation imposed in subsection (c) and may call a referendum for that purpose.  The referendum may be held at the same time as any other referendum or election, but may not be otherwise held within the period of time beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after any other referendum or election.  The referendum shall be conducted by the county board of elections.
The proposition submitted to the voters shall be substantially in the following form:  “Shall the property tax rate limitation applicable to __________ County be increased from ___ on the one hundred dollars ($100.00) value of property subject to taxation to __________ on the one hundred dollars ($100.00) value of property subject to taxation?”
If a majority of those participating in the referendum approve the proposition, the rate limitation imposed in subsection (c) shall be increased for the county.


(f) With respect to any of the categories listed in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the county may provide the necessary personnel, land, buildings, equipment, supplies, and financial support from property tax revenues for the program, function, or service.


(g) This section does not authorize any county to undertake any program, function, joint undertaking, or service not otherwise authorized by law.  It is intended only to authorize the levy of property taxes within the limitations set out herein to finance programs, functions, or services authorized by other portions of the General Statutes or by local acts.

(6) Repealed by 
S.L. 2011-239, § 1, eff. June 23, 2011
.


(7) Any other information needed by the Board to determine the amount of annual assessment payable by the applicant.



(1) The name and address of the applicant and the name and address of the person whose name will appear on the label, if other than the applicant.

S.L. 2011-239, § 1, eff. June 23, 2011
.


(7) Any other information needed by the Board to determine the amount of annual assessment payable by the applicant.


(b) The applicant shall pay an annual registration fee of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) plus an additional annual assessment for each brand or grade of pesticide registered.  The annual assessment shall be fifty dollars ($50.00) if the applicant's gross sales of the pesticide in this State for the preceding 12 months for the period ending September 30th were more than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) and twenty-five dollars ($25.00) if gross sales were less than five thousand dollars ($5,000.00).  An additional two hundred dollars ($200.00) delinquent registration penalty shall be assessed against the registrant for each brand or grade of pesticide which is marketed in North Carolina prior to registration as required by this Article.  In the case of multi-year registration, the annual fee and additional assessment for each year shall be paid at the time of the initial registration.  The Board shall give a pro rata refund of the registration fee and additional assessment to the registrant in the event that registration is canceled by the Board or by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.


(c) The Board, when it deems necessary in the administration of this Article, may require the submission of the complete formula of any pesticide.

(g) Any pesticide declared to be discontinued by the registrant must be registered by the registrant for one full year after distribution is discontinued.  Any pesticide in channels of distribution after the aforesaid registration period may be confiscated and disposed of by the Board, unless the pesticide is acceptable for registration and is continued to be registered by the manufacturer or the person offering the pesticide for wholesale or retail sale.  Provided, however, this subsection shall not apply to any brand or grade of pesticide which the Board determines does not remain in channels of distribution due to method of sale by registrant directly to users thereof.


(h) A pesticide may be registered by the Board for experimental use, including use to control wild animal or bird populations, even though the Wildlife Resources Commission may not have concurred in the declaration of the animal or bird populations as pests under the terms of Article 22A of Chapter 113 of the General Statutes.


(i) The Board shall be empowered to set forth criteria for determining when a given product constitutes a different or separate brand or grade of pesticide.

North Carolina General Statutes Chapter 136. Transportation § 136-251. Findings of fact,https://codes.findlaw.com/nc/chapter-136-transportation/nc-gen-st-sect-136-251.html,"
(1) Increased use of rail for transport of freight will reduce highway congestion as well as allow economic expansion in a way that lessens the impact on the State highway system.


(2) Public transportation, in addition to a program of urban loops and toll roads, will enable North Carolina to have a balanced 21st century transportation system.


(3) As part of its initial program of internal improvements, the State capitalized the North Carolina Railroad in the 1840s and invested in other railroads, and those internal improvements led to North Carolina's rapid economic development.  The North Carolina Railroad, with a 317-mile corridor from Charlotte to Morehead City, is still owned by the State.


(4) Improved rail facilities and restoration of abandoned rail lines can allow increased access to the North Carolina State ports and military installations located within the State.


(5) Session Law 2005-222 found that expanding and upgrading passenger, freight, commuter, and short-line rail service is important to the economy of North Carolina;  and provided that the State would seek to provide matching funds partly so it can leverage the maximum federal and private participation to fund needed rail initiatives, such as the restoration of the rail corridor from Wallace to Castle Hayne and a rail connection between north-south and east-west routes in the vicinity of Pembroke.


(6) Rail freight plays a vital role in economic development throughout the State.  Intermodal service depends on partnerships with railroads, trucking companies, seaports, and others in the transportation logistics chain.  North Carolina has 3,250 mainline miles of track, with Class I railroads holding seventy-nine percent (79%) of the trackage rights, the remainder controlled by local railroads and switching and terminal railroads.  The 2006 Mid-Cycle Update to the North Carolina Statewide Intermodal Transportation Plan identified seven hundred ninety-nine million dollars ($799,000,000) in freight rail needs over the next 25 years, including maintenance and preservation, modernization, and expansion.


(7) North Carolina's short-line railroads play a key role in the State's economic development and transportation service and are needed to provide essential services to other modes of transportation and the North Carolina port system.  North Carolina agriculture is dependent upon essential service by short-line railroads.  State funds are needed to maintain short-line railroads as viable contributors to economic development, agriculture, and transportation in this State in order to prevent the loss of regional rail service.  The Department of Transportation reported that 44,992 rail cars handled by short-lines kept 179,688 trucks off North Carolina highways.  Short-line railroads are essential to preserve and develop jobs in rural and small urban areas of North Carolina.


(8) Intermodal facilities and inland ports can greatly reduce freight traffic on North Carolina's highway system, reducing demand, congestion, and damage.


(9) The proposed North Carolina International Terminal will need high-capacity intermodal access.


(10) Most of North Carolina's growth is in its urban regions.  According to the State Data Center, during the first decade of the 21st century, sixty-six percent (66%) of the projected 1,270,000 growth in population is in 15 urban counties surrounding Charlotte, Raleigh, and the Triad, while forty percent (40%) is in just six counties:  Mecklenburg, Wake, Durham, Orange, Forsyth, and Guilford.


(11) This large urban population growth greatly taxes resources.  Despite the visionary creation of the Highway Trust Fund by the 1989 General Assembly and the funding of urban loop highways, congestion continues to worsen.  Creation of a special fund to help meet urban transportation needs with alternatives such as rail transit and buses, coupled with land-use planning, will spur and guide economic development in a more economically and environmentally sound manner.  Investment in public transportation facilitates economic opportunity to the State through job creation, access to employment, and residential and commercial development.  Public transportation also protects the public health by decreasing air pollution and reducing carbon emissions.  It reduces traffic congestion, road expenditures, public and private parking costs, and the number of traffic accidents.  Charlotte's recent success in opening the first phase of its light rail system, with ridership significantly over projections, shows that North Carolinians are willing to use transportation alternatives.


(12) Significant local revenues are needed to match State funds so that a major portion of the expenses is borne by the localities receiving the majority of the benefits.  A local option sales tax for public transportation was approved by a fifty-eight percent (58%) favorable vote in Mecklenburg County in 1998 and reaffirmed by a seventy percent (70%) favorable vote in 2007.  Extending this authority to additional jurisdictions, along with other revenue options, will enable localities to demonstrate local support for additional transit options.


(13) Surveys have indicated broad public support for providing additional public transportation options and for allowing localities to generate revenue to match State grants.

(1) Rates or loss costs shall not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.


(2) Due consideration shall be given to actual loss and expense experience within this State for the most recent three-year period for which that information is available;  to prospective loss and expense experience within this State;  to the hazards of conflagration and catastrophe;  to a reasonable margin for underwriting profit and to contingencies;  to dividends, savings, or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members, or subscribers;  to investment income earned or realized by insurers from their unearned premium, loss, and loss expense reserve funds generated from business within this State;  to past and prospective expenses specially applicable to this State;  and to all other relevant factors within this State:  Provided, however, that countrywide expense and loss experience and other countrywide data may be considered only where credible North Carolina experience or data is not available.


(3) In the case of property insurance rates under this Article, consideration may be given to the experience of property insurance business during the most recent five-year period for which that experience is available.  In the case of property insurance rates under this Article, consideration shall be given to the insurance public protection classifications of fire districts established by the Commissioner.  The Commissioner shall establish and modify from time to time insurance public protection districts for all rural areas of the State and for cities with populations of 100,000 or fewer, according to the most recent annual population estimates certified by the State Budget Officer.  In establishing and modifying these districts, the Commissioner shall use standards at least equivalent to those used by the Insurance Services Office, Inc., or any successor organization, except that fire alarms that are unintentional or the result of malfunction and result in no damage or fire shall not be considered in calculating minimum response requirements for initial rating or classification.  The standards developed by the Commissioner are subject to Article 2A of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes.  The insurance public protection classifications established by the Commissioner issued pursuant to the provisions of this Article shall be subject to appeal as provided in 
G.S. 58-2-75, et seq.
  The exceptions stated in 
G.S. 58-2-75(a)
 do not apply.  If the Rate Bureau presents any modeled hurricane losses based upon a commercial hurricane simulation computer model with a property insurance rate filing, the Bureau shall present data from more than one such model.  The Commissioner shall consider modeled hurricane losses presented by the Rate Bureau.


(4) Risks may be grouped by classifications and lines of insurance for establishment of rates, loss costs, and base premiums.  Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans that establish standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions or both.   Those standards may measure any differences among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.  The Bureau shall establish and implement a comprehensive classification rating plan for motor vehicle insurance under its jurisdiction.  No such classification plans shall base any standard or rating plan for private passenger (nonfleet) motor vehicles, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, upon the age or gender of the persons insured.  The Bureau shall at least once every three years make a complete review of the filed classification rates to determine whether they are proper and supported by statistical evidence, and shall at least once every 10 years make a complete review of the territories for nonfleet private passenger motor vehicle insurance to determine whether they are proper and reasonable.


(5) In the case of workers' compensation insurance and employers' liability insurance written in connection therewith, due consideration shall be given to the past and prospective effects of changes in compensation benefits and in legal and medical fees that are provided for in General Statutes Chapter 97.


(6) To ensure that policyholders in the beach and coastal areas of the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association whose risks are of the same class and essentially the same hazard are charged premiums that are commensurate with the risk of loss and premiums that are actuarially correct, the North Carolina Rate Bureau shall revise, monitor, and review the existing territorial boundaries used by the Bureau when appropriate to establish geographic territories in the beach and coastal areas of the Association for rating purposes.  In revising these territories, the Bureau shall use statistical data sources available to define such territories to represent relative risk factors that are actuarially sound and not unfairly discriminatory.  The new territories and any subsequent amendments proposed by the North Carolina Rate Bureau or Association shall be subject to the Commissioner's approval and shall appear on the Bureau's Web site, the Association's Web site, and the Department's Web site once approved.


(7) Property insurance rates established under this Article may include a provision to reflect the cost of reinsurance to protect against catastrophic exposure within this State.  Amounts to be paid to reinsurers, ceding commissions paid or to be paid to insurers by reinsurers, expected reinsurance recoveries, North Carolina exposure to catastrophic events relative to other states' exposure, and any other relevant information may be considered when determining the provision to reflect the cost of reinsurance.

(a) The states party to this agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession.  It is the purpose of this agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the states party to it, and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.


(b) The party states find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations.  Variations from state to state in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other states.  As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems.  Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their states of origin, can increase the available educational resources.  Participation in this Compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.

(f) Operation of Channels. -- A cable service provider is responsible only for the transmission of a PEG channel.  The county or city to which the PEG channel is provided is responsible for the operation and content of the channel.  A county or city that provides content to a cable service provider for transmission on a PEG channel is considered to have authorized the provider to transmit the content throughout the provider's service area, regardless of whether part of the service area is outside the boundaries of the county or city.
All programming on a PEG channel must be noncommercial.  A cable service provider may not brand content on a PEG channel with its logo, name, or other identifying marks.  A cable service provider is not required to transmit content on a PEG channel that is branded with the logo, name, or other identifying marks of another cable service provider.


(g) Compliance. -- A county or city that has not received PEG channel capacity as required by this section may bring an action to compel a cable service provider to comply with this section.

The authority shall file an application for approval of its proposed bond issue with the Secretary of the Local Government Commission, and shall notify the Secretary of Commerce of the filing if the project is an industrial project or pollution control project.


(b) In determining whether a proposed bond issue should be approved, the Local Government Commission may consider any of the following:

(1) Whether the proposed operator and obligor have demonstrated or can demonstrate the financial responsibility and capability to fulfill their obligations with respect to the financing agreement.  In making such determination, the Commission may consider the operator's experience and the obligor's ratio of current assets to current liabilities, net worth, earnings trends and coverage of fixed charges, the nature of the industry or business involved and its stability and any additional security such as credit enhancement, insurance, guaranties or property to be pledged to secure such bonds.


(2) Whether the political subdivisions in or near which the proposed project is to be located have the ability to cope satisfactorily with the impact of the project and to provide, or cause to be provided, the public facilities and services, including utilities, that will be necessary for the project and on account of any increase in population which are expected to result from the project.

(d) If the initial proposed operator of the project is not expected to be the operator for the term of the bonds proposed to be issued, the Local Government Commission may consider the matters required under subdivision (b)(1) of this section only with respect to the initial operator.  The obligor shall be obligated to perform all of the duties of the obligor required hereunder during the term the bonds are outstanding.  The Local Government Commission shall evaluate the obligor's ability to perform these duties without regard to whether the initial proposed operator of the project is expected to be the operator for the term of the bonds proposed to be issued.  To facilitate the review of the proposed bond issue by the Commission, the Secretary may require the authority to obtain and submit any financial data and information about the proposed bond issue and the security for it, including the proposed prospectus or offering circular, the proposed financing agreement and security document and annual and other financial reports and statements of the obligor, as the Secretary may prescribe.  The Secretary may also prescribe any forms and rules the Secretary considers reasonably necessary to implement the provisions of this section.

North Carolina General Statutes Chapter 106. Agriculture § 106-812. Findings,https://codes.findlaw.com/nc/chapter-106-agriculture/nc-gen-st-sect-106-812.html,"
(a) The General Assembly finds that North Carolina has suffered a significant loss of its traditional industrial and agricultural economic base.  The State's dairy industry is at serious risk of total collapse unless milk prices reach levels sufficient to allow dairy farmers to meet production costs.  At the same time, North Carolina is experiencing rapid population growth and urbanization.  This growth and urbanization have fueled a rapid loss of prime agricultural land and green space, resulting in a decline in the quality of life for which the State is known.


(b) The General Assembly finds that the dairy industry in North Carolina makes a substantial economic, environmental, and quality-of-life contribution to the well-being of the citizens of the State.  The dairy industry, including both producers and processors, currently contributes over six hundred million dollars ($600,000,000) and 3,000 jobs to the State's economy.  Properly managed dairy farms help maintain green space, keep prime agricultural land under production, maintain water quality, enhance food security, and provide a local supply of fresh milk at a reasonable cost to the consumer and to processors in the State.  An adequate local milk supply has become increasingly important as transportation costs escalate, making the importation of milk from out-of-state increasingly expensive.  The General Assembly finds, however, that despite its importance to the State's economic and environmental well-being, North Carolina's dairy industry is under severe economic pressure, and milk production is declining at an alarming rate.  According to United States Department of Agriculture statistics, since 1985 the State has lost sixty-seven percent (67%) of its dairy farms and thirty-five percent (35%) of its processing facilities.  North Carolina dairy farms no longer produce sufficient milk for North Carolina's processing facilities to operate.  Milk must be imported 10 out of 12 months each year to keep these processing facilities functioning.  Further, farm prices for milk exhibit great volatility, creating financial risk and discouraging investment.  The General Assembly finds that it is essential to a viable North Carolina dairy industry to have locally produced milk available to processors in the State.  The General Assembly further finds that it is essential to the well-being of the citizens of the State to have a local supply of fresh milk available at reasonable cost and not subject to the vagaries of transportation costs and production conditions in other regions of the country.


(c) The General Assembly finds that one of the primary reasons for the decline in milk production in the State is the gap between the price paid to farmers for milk under the federal milk programs and the actual cost of production.  Inability to meet production costs combined with increasing land prices have led many milk producers to sell their farms for development and retire or turn to other employment.  The General Assembly finds that the most effective means to ensure the continuation of a viable dairy industry in this State is to establish a price floor for milk to enable dairy farmers to meet their production costs.  It is the intent of the General Assembly to establish a price support program that will stabilize and reverse the decline in the local milk supply and in the dairy industry in the State and encourage new producers to enter the dairy industry.  Sustaining and growing North Carolina's dairy industry will advance the State's goals of preserving and enhancing its economic base and improving the quality of life in the State through maintaining green space and water quality and assuring an adequate local supply of fresh milk.

North Carolina General Statutes Chapter 113A. Pollution Control and Environment § 113A-102. Legislative findings and goals,https://codes.findlaw.com/nc/chapter-113a-pollution-control-and-environment/nc-gen-st-sect-113a-102.html,"
(a) Findings.--It is hereby determined and declared as a matter of legislative finding that among North Carolina's most valuable resources are its coastal lands and waters.  The coastal area, and in particular the estuaries, are among the most biologically productive regions of this State and of the nation.  Coastal and estuarine waters and marshlands provide almost ninety percent (90%) of the most productive sport fisheries on the east coast of the United States.  North Carolina's coastal area has an extremely high recreational and esthetic value which should be preserved and enhanced.
In recent years the coastal area has been subjected to increasing pressures which are the result of the often-conflicting needs of a society expanding in industrial development, in population, and in the recreational aspirations of its citizens.  Unless these pressures are controlled by coordinated management, the very features of the coast which make it economically, esthetically, and ecologically rich will be destroyed.  The General Assembly therefore finds that an immediate and pressing need exists to establish a comprehensive plan for the protection, preservation, orderly development, and management of the coastal area of North Carolina.
In the implementation of the coastal area management plan, the public's opportunity to enjoy the physical, esthetic, cultural, and recreational qualities of the natural shorelines of the State shall be preserved to the greatest extent feasible;  water resources shall be managed in order to preserve and enhance water quality and to provide optimum utilization of water resources;  land resources shall be managed in order to guide growth and development and to minimize damage to the natural environment;  and private property rights shall be preserved in accord with the Constitution of this State and of the United States.


(b) Goals.--The goals of the coastal area management system to be created pursuant to this Article are as follows:

(1) To provide a management system capable of preserving and managing the natural ecological conditions of the estuarine system, the barrier dune system, and the beaches, so as to safeguard and perpetuate their natural productivity and their biological, economic and esthetic values;


(2) To insure that the development or preservation of the land and water resources of the coastal area proceeds in a manner consistent with the capability of the land and water for development, use, or preservation based on ecological considerations;


(3) To insure the orderly and balanced use and preservation of our coastal resources on behalf of the people of North Carolina and the nation;


(4) To establish policies, guidelines and standards for:

a. Protection, preservation, and conservation of natural resources including but not limited to water use, scenic vistas, and fish and wildlife;  and management of transitional or intensely developed areas and areas especially suited to intensive use or development, as well as areas of significant natural value;


b. The economic development of the coastal area, including but not limited to construction, location and design of industries, port facilities, commercial establishments and other developments;


c. Recreation and tourist facilities and parklands;


d. Transportation and circulation patterns for the coastal area including major thoroughfares, transportation routes, navigation channels and harbors, and other public utilities and facilities;


e. Preservation and enhancement of the historic, cultural, and scientific aspects of the coastal area;


f. Protection of present common-law and statutory public rights in the lands and waters of the coastal area;


g. Any other purposes deemed necessary or appropriate to effectuate the policy of this Article.

Seasons and bag limits on wild animals and birds;  including animals and birds taken in bag;  possession and transportation of wildlife after taking,https://codes.findlaw.com/nc/chapter-113-conservation-and-development/nc-gen-st-sect-113-291-2.html,"
(a) In accordance with the supply of wildlife and other factors it determines to be of public importance, the Wildlife Resources Commission may fix seasons and bag limits upon the wild animals and wild birds authorized to be taken that it deems necessary or desirable in the interests of the conservation of wildlife resources.  The authority to fix seasons includes the closing of seasons completely when necessary and fixing the hours of hunting.  The authority to fix bag limits includes the setting of season and possession limits.  Different seasons and bag limits may be set in differing areas;  early or extended seasons and different or unlimited bag limits may be authorized on controlled shooting preserves, game lands, and public hunting grounds;  and special or extended seasons may be fixed for those engaging in falconry, using primitive weapons, or taking wildlife under other special conditions.
Unless modified by rules of the Wildlife Resources Commission or as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the seasons, shooting hours, bag limits, and possession limits fixed by the United States Department of Interior or any successor agency for migratory game birds in North Carolina must be followed, and a violation of the applicable federal rules is hereby made unlawful.  When the applicable federal rules require that the State limit participation in seasons and/or bag limits for migratory game birds, the Wildlife Resources Commission may schedule managed hunts for migratory game birds.  Participants in such hunts shall be selected at random by computer, and each applicant 16 years of age or older shall have the required general hunting license and the waterfowl hunting license prior to the drawing for the managed hunt.  Each applicant under 16 years of age shall either have the required general hunting license and the waterfowl hunting license or shall apply as a member of a party that includes a properly licensed adult.  All applications for managed waterfowl hunts shall be screened prior to the drawing for compliance with these requirements.  A nonrefundable fee of ten dollars ($10.00) shall be required of each applicant to defray the cost of processing the applications.


(a1) When the Executive Director of the Wildlife Resources Commission receives a petition from the State Health Director declaring a rabies emergency for a particular county or district pursuant to 
G.S. 130A-201
, the Executive Director of the Wildlife Resources Commission shall develop a plan to reduce the threat of rabies exposure to humans and domestic animals by foxes, raccoons, skunks, or bobcats in the county or district.  The plan shall be based upon the best veterinary and wildlife management information and techniques available.  The plan may involve a suspension or liberalization of any regulatory restriction on the taking of foxes, raccoons, skunks, or bobcats, except that the use of poisons, other than those used with dart guns, shall not be permitted under any circumstance.  If the plan involves a suspension or liberalization of any regulatory restriction on the taking of foxes, raccoons, skunks, or bobcats, the Executive Director of the Wildlife Resources Commission shall prepare and adopt temporary rules setting out the suspension or liberalization pursuant to 
G.S. 150B-21.1(a)(1)
.  The Executive Director shall publicize the plan and the temporary rules in the major news outlets that serve the county or district to inform the public of the actions being taken and the reasons for them.  Upon notification by the State Health Director that the rabies emergency no longer exists, the Executive Director of the Wildlife Resources Commission shall cancel the plan and repeal any rules adopted to implement the plan.  The Executive Director of the Wildlife Resources Commission shall publicize the cancellation of the plan and the repeal of any rules in the major news outlets that serve the county or district.


(b) Any individual hunter or trapper who in taking a wild animal or bird has wounded or otherwise disabled it must make a reasonable effort to capture and kill the animal or bird.  All animals and birds taken that can be retrieved must be retrieved and counted with respect to any applicable bag limits governing the individual taking the animal or bird.


(c) An individual who has lawfully taken game within applicable bag, possession, and season limits may, except as limited by rules adopted pursuant to subsection (c1) of this section, after the game is dead, possess and personally transport it for his own use by virtue of his hunting license, and without any additional permit, subject to tagging and reporting requirements that may apply to the fox and big game, as follows:

(1) In an area in which the season is open for the species, the game may be possessed and transported without restriction.


(2) The individual may possess and transport the game lawfully taken on a trip:

a. To his residence;


b. To a preservation or processing facility that keeps adequate records as prescribed in 
G.S. 113-291.3(b)(3)
 or a licensed taxidermist;


c. From a place authorized in subparagraph b to his residence.



(3) The individual may possess the game indefinitely at his residence, and may there accumulate lawfully-acquired game up to the greater of:

a. The applicable possession limit for each species;  or


b. One half of the applicable season limit for each species.


The above subdivisions apply to an individual hunter under 16 years of age covered by the license issued to his parent or guardian, if he is using that license, or by the license of an adult accompanying him.  An individual who has lawfully taken game as a landholder without a license may possess and transport the dead game, taken within applicable bag, possession, and season limits, to his residence.  He may indefinitely retain possession of such game, within aggregate possession limits for the species in question, in his residence.


(1) In an area in which the season is open for the species, the game may be possessed and transported without restriction.


(2) The individual may possess and transport the game lawfully taken on a trip:

a. To his residence;

(c1) In the event that the Executive Director finds that game carcasses or parts of game carcasses are known or suspected to carry an infectious or contagious disease that poses an imminent threat to the health or habitat of wildlife species, the Wildlife Resources Commission shall adopt rules to regulate the importation, transportation, or possession of those carcasses or parts of carcasses that, according to wildlife disease experts, may transmit such a disease.


(d) Except in the situations specifically provided for above, the Wildlife Resources Commission may by rule impose reporting, permit, and tagging requirements that may be necessary upon persons:

(1) Possessing dead wildlife taken in open season after the close of that season.


(2) Transporting dead wildlife from an area having an open season to an area with a closed season.


(3) Transporting dead wildlife lawfully taken in another state into this State.


(4) Possessing dead wildlife after such transportation.

(e) Upon application of any landholder or agent of a landholder accompanied by a fee of fifty dollars ($50.00), the Executive Director may issue to such landholder or agent a special license and a number of special antlerless or antlered deer tags that in the judgment of the Executive Director is sufficient to accommodate the landholder or the landholder's agent's deer population management objectives or correct any deer population imbalance that may occur on the property.  Subject to applicable hunting license requirements, the special deer tags may be used by any person or persons selected by the landholder or his agent as authority to take antlerless deer, including male deer with “buttons” or spikes not readily visible, or antlered deer on the tract of land concerned during any established deer hunting season.  The Executive Director or designee may stipulate on the license that special deer tags for antlered deer, if applicable, may only be valid for deer that meet certain minimum harvest criteria.  The Executive Director or designee may also define on the license valid hunt dates that fall outside of the general deer hunting season.  Harvested antlerless or antlered deer for which special tags are issued shall be affixed immediately with a special deer tag and shall be reported immediately in the wildlife cooperator tagging book supplied with the special deer tags.  This tagging book and any unused tags shall be returned to the Commission within 15 days of the close of the season.  The Wildlife Resources Commission may offer an alternate reporting system when the Commission determines that such an alternate system is appropriate.  Antlerless or antlered deer taken under this program and tagged with the special tags provided shall not count as part of the daily bag, possession, and season limits of the person taking the deer.


(f) The Commission is authorized to issue proclamations to set seasons, shooting hours, bag limits, and possession limits that are congruent with the season framework established by the United States Department of Interior or any successor agency.  The Commission may delegate this authority to the Executive Director.  Each proclamation shall state the hour and date upon which it becomes effective and shall be issued at least 48 hours prior to the effective date and time.  A permanent file of the text of all proclamations shall be maintained in the office of the Executive Director.  Certified copies of proclamations are entitled to judicial notice in any civil or criminal proceeding.
The Executive Director shall make a reasonable effort to give notice of the terms of any proclamation to persons who may be affected by it.  This effort shall include press releases to communications media, posting of notices at boating access areas and other places where persons affected may gather, personal communication by agents of the Wildlife Resources Commission, and other measures designed to reach persons who may be affected.  Proclamations under this subsection shall remain in force until rescinded following the same procedure established for enactment.

(a) Each municipality, not located within a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) as recognized in 
G.S. 136-200.1
, with the cooperation of the Department of Transportation, shall develop a comprehensive transportation plan that will serve present and anticipated travel demand in and around the municipality.  The plan shall be based on the best information available including, but not limited to, population growth, economic conditions and prospects, and patterns of land development in and around the municipality, and shall provide for the safe and effective use of the transportation system. In the development of the plan, consideration shall be given to all transportation modes including, but not limited to, the street system, transit alternatives, bicycle, pedestrian, and operating strategies.  The Department of Transportation may provide financial and technical assistance in the preparation of such plans.  Each MPO, with cooperation of the Department of Transportation, shall develop a comprehensive transportation plan in accordance with 
23 U.S.C. § 134
.  In addition, an MPO may include projects in its transportation plan that are not included in a financially constrained plan or are anticipated to be needed beyond the horizon year as required by 
23 U.S.C. § 134
.  For municipalities located within an MPO, the development of a comprehensive transportation plan will take place through the metropolitan planning organization.  For purposes of transportation planning and programming, the MPO shall represent the municipality's interests to the Department of Transportation.


(b) After completion and analysis of the plan, the plan shall be adopted by both the governing body of the municipality or MPO and the Department of Transportation as the basis for future transportation improvements in and around the municipality or within the MPO.  The governing body of the municipality and the Department of Transportation shall reach agreement as to which of the existing and proposed streets and highways included in the adopted plan will be a part of the State highway system and which streets will be a part of the municipal street system.  As used in this Article, the State highway system shall mean both the primary highway system of the State and the secondary road system of the State within municipalities.


(b1) The Department of Transportation may participate in the development and adoption of a transportation plan or updated transportation plan when all local governments within the area covered by the transportation plan have adopted land development plans within the previous five years.  The Department of Transportation may participate in the development of a transportation plan if all the municipalities and counties within the area covered by the transportation plan are in the process of developing a land development plan.  The Department of Transportation may not adopt or update a transportation plan until a local land development plan has been adopted.  A qualifying land development plan may be a comprehensive plan, land use plan, master plan, strategic plan, or any type of plan or policy document that expresses a jurisdiction's goals and objectives for the development of land within that jurisdiction.  At the request of the local jurisdiction, the Department may review and provide comments on the plan but shall not provide approval of the land development plan.


(b2) The municipality or the MPO shall provide opportunity for public comments prior to adoption of the transportation plan.


(b3) Each county, with the cooperation of the Department of Transportation, may develop a comprehensive transportation plan utilizing the procedures specified for municipalities in subsection (a) of this section.  This plan may be adopted by both the governing body of the county and the Department of Transportation.  For portions of a county located within an MPO, the development of a comprehensive transportation plan shall take place through the metropolitan planning organization.


(b4) To complement the roadway element of the transportation plan, municipalities and MPOs may develop a collector street plan to assist in developing the roadway network.  The Department of Transportation may review and provide comments but is not required to provide approval of the collector street plan.


(c) From and after the date that the plan is adopted, the streets and highways designated in the plan as the responsibility of the Department of Transportation shall become a part of the State highway system and all such system streets shall be subject to the provisions of 
G.S. 136-93
, and all streets designated in the plan as the responsibility of the municipality shall become a part of the municipal street system.


(d) For municipalities not located within an MPO, either the municipality or the Department of Transportation may propose changes in the plan at any time by giving notice to the other party, but no change shall be effective until it is adopted by both the Department of Transportation and the municipal governing board.  For MPOs, either the MPO or the Department of Transportation may propose changes in the plan at any time by giving notice to the other party, but no change shall be effective until it is adopted by both the Department of Transportation and the MPO.


(e) Until the adoption of a comprehensive transportation plan that includes future development of the street system in and around municipalities, the Department of Transportation and any municipality may reach an agreement as to which existing or proposed streets and highways within the municipal boundaries shall be added to or removed from the State highway system.


(f) Streets within municipalities which are on the State highway system as of July 1, 1959, shall continue to be on that system until changes are made as provided in this section.


(g) The street and highway elements of the plans developed pursuant to 
G.S. 136-66.2
 shall serve as the plan referenced in 
G.S. 136-66.10(a)

(b) The county board of commissioners of each county in the district shall appoint one county commissioner to the district board of health.  The county commissioner members of the district board of health shall appoint the other members of the board, including at least one physician licensed to practice medicine in this State, one licensed dentist, one licensed optometrist, one licensed veterinarian, one registered nurse, one licensed pharmacist, and one professional engineer.  The composition of the board shall reasonably reflect the population makeup of the entire district and provide equitable district-wide representation.  All members shall be residents of the district.  If there is not a licensed physician, a licensed dentist, a licensed optometrist, a licensed veterinarian, a registered nurse, a licensed pharmacist, or a professional engineer available for appointment, an additional representative of the general public shall be appointed.  If however, one of the designated professions has only one person residing in the district, the county commissioner members shall have the option of appointing that person or a member of the general public.


(c) Except as provided in this subsection, members of a district board of health shall serve terms of three years.  Two of the original members shall serve terms of one year and two of the original members shall serve terms of two years.  No member shall serve more than three consecutive three-year terms unless the member is the only person residing in the district who represents one of the professions designated in subsection (b) of this section.  County commissioner members shall serve only as long as the member is a county commissioner.  When a representative of the general public is appointed due to the unavailability of a licensed physician, a licensed dentist, a licensed optometrist, a licensed veterinarian, a registered nurse, a licensed pharmacist, or a professional engineer that member shall serve only until a licensed physician, a licensed dentist, a licensed optometrist, a licensed veterinarian, a registered nurse, a licensed pharmacist, or a professional engineer becomes available for appointment.  The county commissioner members may appoint a member for less than a three-year term to achieve a staggered term structure.


(d) Whenever a county shall join or withdraw from an existing district health department, the district board of health shall be dissolved and a new board shall be appointed as provided in subsection (c).


(e) Vacancies shall be filled for any unexpired portion of a term.


(f) A chairperson shall be elected annually by a district board of health.  The local health director shall serve as secretary to the board.


(g) A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum.


(h) A member may be removed from office by the district board of health for:

(1) Commission of a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude;


(2) Violation of a State law governing conflict of interest;


(3) Violation of a written policy adopted by the county board of commissioners of each county in the district;


(4) Habitual failure to attend meetings;


(5) Conduct that tends to bring the office into disrepute;  or


(6) Failure to maintain qualifications for appointment required under subsection (b) of this section.

A board member may be removed only after the member has been given written notice of the basis for removal and has had the opportunity to respond.


(1) Commission of a felony or other crime involving moral turpitude;


(2) Violation of a State law governing conflict of interest;


(3) Violation of a written policy adopted by the county board of commissioners of each county in the district;

(a) The General Assembly finds and determines that the Tax Reform Act of 1984 established a federal volume limitation upon the aggregate amount of “private activity bonds” that may be issued by each state;  that, pursuant to 
Section 103(n) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954
, as amended, a previous Governor of North Carolina issued Executive Order 113 proclaiming a formula for allocating the federal volume limitation for North Carolina;  that on October 22, 1986, the Tax Reform Act of 1986, hereinafter referred to as the “Tax Reform Act”, was enacted;  that the Tax Reform Act (i) establishes a new unified limitation for private activity bonds on a state by state basis, (ii) establishes a new definition of the types of private activity bonds to be included under those new limitations, (iii) establishes a new low-income housing credit to induce the construction of and the improvement of housing for low-income people, and (iv) limits the aggregate use of this low-income housing credit on a state by state basis;  that the Tax Reform Act provides for federal formulas for the allocation of these “state by state” resources, and also provides for states which cannot use the federal formula for allocation to set allocation procedures and formulas which are more appropriate for the individual states;  that the Tax Reform Act gives authority for the legislature of each state to formulate and execute plans for allocation;  and that 
Section 146 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
, as amended, and 
Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
, as amended, will require continued inquiry and study in the ways in which North Carolina can best and most fairly manage and utilize resources provided therein.


(b) The General Assembly further finds and determines that the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 added new subsections (a)(13) and (k) to 
section 142 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
, as amended, which (i) establish a new type of private activity bond that can be issued to finance “qualified public educational facilities,” (ii) establish an annual aggregate limitation on the face amount of qualified public educational facility bonds that may be issued on a state-by-state basis, (iii) provide that each state may allocate the annual aggregate limitation for any calendar year in such manner as each state determines appropriate, and (iv) provide for an elective carryforward by each state of the unused annual aggregate limitation;  and that subsections (a)(13) and (k) will require continued inquiry and study in the ways in which North Carolina can best and most fairly manage and utilize the resource provided therein.


(c) The General Assembly further finds and determines that section 1400U-3 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009 (ARRTA) added a new type of exempt facility bond called “recovery zone facility bonds” to be used to finance construction, renovation, and equipping of recovery zone property for use in any trade or business in a recovery zone, all as defined in ARRTA, and a new type of governmental bond called “recovery zone economic development bonds.”  The ARRTA provides a formula for allocation of authority to issue recovery zone facility bonds and recovery zone economic development bonds to the states and by which the authority is to be reallocated by the State to counties and large municipalities within the State.


(d) The General Assembly further finds and determines that 
section 54D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
, as amended, permits the issuance of tax credit bonds called “qualified energy conservation bonds” (QECBs), the proceeds of which must be used for certain energy conservation purposes enumerated in 
section 54D
.  
Section 54D
 and ARRTA provide a national bond limitation for the issuance of QECBs, and the Treasury Department has allocated that authority among the states.  Under 
section 54D
, the United States is required to reallocate the authority to issue QECBs to the counties and large local governments within the states based on population, in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Treasury Department, and to assure that not more than thirty percent (30%) of the QECBs issued in a state are used for private activity bonds, as defined in 
section 54D

(a) Each county board of elections is authorized, in its discretion, to appoint two or more assistants for each precinct to aid the chief judge and judges.  Not more than two assistants shall be appointed in precincts having 500 or less registered voters.  Assistants shall be qualified voters of the county in which the precinct is located.  When the board of elections determines that assistants are needed in a precinct an equal number shall be appointed from different political parties, unless the requirement as to party affiliation cannot be met because of an insufficient number of voters of different political parties within the county.
In the discretion of the county board of elections, a precinct assistant may serve less than the full day prescribed for chief judges and judges in 
G. S. 163A-823(a)
.


(b) The chairman of each political party in the county shall have the right to recommend from three to 10 registered voters in each precinct for appointment as precinct assistants in that precinct.  If the recommendations are received by it no later than the thirtieth day prior to the primary or election, the board shall make appointments of the precinct assistants for each precinct from the names thus recommended.  If the recommendations of the party chairs for precinct assistant in a precinct are insufficient, the county board of elections by unanimous vote of all of its members may name to serve as precinct assistant in that precinct registered voters in that precinct who were not recommended by the party chairs.  If, after diligently seeking to fill the positions with registered voters of the precinct, the county board still has an insufficient number of precinct assistants for the precinct, the county board by unanimous vote of all of its members may appoint to the positions registered voters in other precincts in the same county who meet the qualifications other than residence to be precinct officials in the precinct.  In making its appointments, the county board shall assure, wherever possible, that no precinct has precinct officials all of whom are registered with the same party.  In no instance shall the county board appoint nonresidents of the precinct to a majority of the positions as precinct assistant in a precinct.


(c) In addition, a county board of elections by unanimous vote of all of its members may appoint any registered voter in the county as emergency election-day assistant, as long as that voter is otherwise qualified to be a precinct official.  The State Board shall determine for each election the number of emergency election-day assistants each county may have, based on population, expected turnout, and complexity of election duties.  The county board by unanimous vote of all of its members may assign emergency election-day assistants on the day of the election to any precinct in the county where the number of precinct officials is insufficient because of an emergency occurring within 48 hours of the opening of the polls that prevents an appointed precinct official from serving.  A person appointed to serve as emergency election-day assistant shall be trained and paid like other precinct assistants in accordance with 
G.S. 163A-822
.  A county board of elections shall apportion the appointments as emergency election-day assistant among registrants of each political party so as to make possible the staffing of each precinct with officials of more than one party, and the county board shall make assignments so that no precinct has precinct officials all of whom are registered with the same party.


(d) Before entering upon the duties of the office, each assistant shall take the oath prescribed in 
G.S. 163A-815(a)
 to be administered by the chief judge of the precinct for which the assistant is appointed.  Assistants serve for the particular primary or election for which they are appointed, unless the county board of elections appoints them for a term to expire on the date appointments are to be made pursuant to 
G.S. 163A-815

G.S. 87-97.1
, when developed property is located so as to be served by an authority water line and the property owner has connected to that water line, the property owner may continue to use any private water well located on the property for nonpotable purposes as long as the water well is not interconnected to the sanitary district water line and the sanitary district shall not require the owner of any such water well to abandon, cap, or otherwise compromise the integrity of the water well.  This subdivision applies only to a water and sewer authority whose membership includes part or all of a county that has a population of at least 40,000 according to the most recent annual population estimates certified by the State Budget Officer.

G.S. 162A-3.1
 and its participating political subdivisions may enter into agreements obligating these subdivisions to make payments to the authority for treated water delivered or made available or expected to be delivered or made available by the authority, regardless of whether treated water is actually delivered or made available.  Such payments may be designed to cover the authority's operating costs (including debt service and related amounts) by allocating those costs among the participating political subdivisions and by requiring these subdivisions to pay additional amounts to make up for the nonpayment of defaulting subdivisions.  The participating political subdivisions may agree to budget for and appropriate such payments.  Such payment obligations may be made absolute, unconditional, and irrevocable and required to be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of such agreements and without abatement or reduction under all circumstances whatsoever, including whether or not any facility of the authority is completed, operable or operating and, notwithstanding the suspension, interruption, interference, reduction or curtailment of the output of any such facility or the treated water contracted for, and such obligations may be made subject to no reduction, whether by offset or otherwise, and not conditioned upon the performance or nonperformance of the authority or any participating political subdivision under any agreement.  Such payment obligations are in consideration of any output or capacity that may at any time be available from facilities of the authority.  The participating political subdivisions may agree to make such payments from limited or specified sources.  To the extent such payments relate to debt service of the authority and related amounts, they may not be made from any moneys derived from exercise by the participating political subdivisions of their taxing power, and such payment obligations shall not constitute a pledge of such taxing power.  The participating political subdivisions may agree (i) not to pledge or encumber any source of payment and (ii) to operate (including fixing rates and charges) in a manner that enables them to make such payments from such sources.  The participating political subdivisions may also secure such payment obligations with a pledge of or lien upon any such sources of payment.  Notwithstanding the provisions of 
G.S. 162A-9
 or any other law to the contrary, an authority entering into any such agreement need not fix rates, fees and other charges for its services except as provided herein, and such rates, fees and charges need not be uniform through the authority's service areas.  Notwithstanding the provisions of 
G.S. 160A-322
 or any other law to the contrary, agreements described herein may have a term not exceeding 50 years.  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the execution and effectiveness of any agreement authorized hereby shall not be subject to any authorizations or approvals by any entity except the parties thereto.  Each authority and its participating political subdivisions shall have the power to do all acts and things necessary or convenient to carry out the powers granted by this subsection.

.


(d) In accordance with governing rules of the Wildlife Resources Commission imposing further restrictions that may be necessary, hunters may conduct field trials with dogs in areas and at times authorized with the use of approved weapons and ammunition.  The Wildlife Resources Commission may authorize organized retriever field trials, utilizing domestically raised waterfowl and game birds, to be held under its permit.


(d1) Except in areas closed to protect sensitive wildlife populations, and subject to conditions and restrictions contained in rules of the Wildlife Resources Commission, hunters may train dogs during the closed season:

(1) With the use of weapons and ammunition approved by the Wildlife Resources Commission;


(2) If reasonable control is exercised to prevent the dogs from running unsupervised at large and from killing wild animals and wild birds;


(3) On land owned or leased by the dog trainer or upon which the person has written permission to train dogs;  and


(4) Using domestically raised waterfowl and game birds, provided the birds are marked and sources are documented as required by the Wildlife Resources Commission.



(1) With the use of weapons and ammunition approved by the Wildlife Resources Commission;


(2) If reasonable control is exercised to prevent the dogs from running unsupervised at large and from killing wild animals and wild birds;


(3) On land owned or leased by the dog trainer or upon which the person has written permission to train dogs;  and


(4) Using domestically raised waterfowl and game birds, provided the birds are marked and sources are documented as required by the Wildlife Resources Commission.


(e) Raccoons and opossum may be taken at night with dogs during seasons set by rules of the Wildlife Resources Commission with the use of artificial lights of a type designed or commonly used to aid in taking raccoon and opossum.  No conveyance may be used in taking any raccoon or opossum at night, but incidental transportation of hunters and dogs to and from the site of hunting is permitted.  The Wildlife Resources Commission may by rule prescribe restrictions respecting the taking of frogs, or other creatures not classified as wildlife which may be found in areas frequented by game, with the use of an artificial light, and may regulate the shining of lights at night in areas frequented by deer as provided in subsection (e1).


(e1) After hearing sufficient evidence and finding as a fact that an area frequented by deer is subject to substantial unlawful night deer hunting or that residents in the area have been greatly inconvenienced by persons shining lights on deer, the Wildlife Resources Commission may by rule prohibit the intentional sweeping of that area with lights, or the intentional shining of lights on deer, during the period either:

(1) From 11:00 p.m. until one-half hour before sunrise;  or


(2) From one-half hour after sunset until one-half hour before sunrise.

Before adopting this rule, the Wildlife Resources Commission must propose it at a public hearing in the area to be closed and seek the reactions of the local inhabitants.  The rule must exempt necessary shining of lights by landholders, motorists engaged in normal travel on the highway, and campers and others legitimately in the area, who are not attempting to attract wildlife.  This subsection does not limit the right of hunters to take raccoon and opossum with dogs lawfully at night with a light under the terms of subsection (e).


(1) From 11:00 p.m. until one-half hour before sunrise;  or


(2) From one-half hour after sunset until one-half hour before sunrise.


(e2) If the Wildlife Resources Commission has enacted a rule under the authority of subsection (e1) prohibiting the shining of lights from 11:00 p.m. until one-half hour before sunrise in any county or area of a county, the Wildlife Resources Commission is authorized, without holding an additional public hearing, to extend the applicability of that rule to the period one-half hour after sunset to one-half hour before sunrise upon receipt of a resolution from the board of commissioners of the county requesting extension of the period.


(f) To keep North Carolina provisions respecting migratory game birds in substantial conformity with applicable federal law and rules, the Wildlife Resources Commission may by rule, or as provided in subsection (f1) of this section, expand or modify provisions of this Article if necessary to achieve such conformity, including allowing the use of electronic calls.  In particular, the Commission may prohibit the use of rifles, unplugged shotguns, live decoys, and sinkboxes in the taking of migratory game birds;  vary shooting hours;  adopt specific distances, not less than 300 yards, hunters must maintain from areas that have been baited, and fix the number of days afterwards during which it is still unlawful to take migratory game birds in the area;  and adopt similar provisions with regard to the use of live decoys.  In the absence of rules of the Wildlife Resources Commission to the contrary, the rules of the United States Department of the Interior prohibiting the use of rifles, unplugged shotguns, toxic shot and sinkboxes in taking migratory game birds in North Carolina shall apply, and any violation of such federal rules is unlawful.


(f1) The Commission is authorized to issue proclamations to allow the use of electronic calls or unplugged shotguns to achieve substantial conformity with applicable federal law and rules established by the United States Department of Interior or any successor agency.  The Commission may delegate this authority to the Executive Director.  Each proclamation shall state the hour and date upon which it becomes effective and shall be issued at least 48 hours prior to the effective date and time.  A permanent file of the text of all proclamations shall be maintained in the office of the Executive Director.  Certified copies of proclamations are entitled to judicial notice in any civil or criminal proceeding.
The Executive Director shall make a reasonable effort to give notice of the terms of any proclamation to persons who may be affected by it.  This effort shall include press releases to communications media, posting of notices at boating access areas and other places where persons affected may gather, personal communication by agents of the Wildlife Resources Commission, and other measures designed to reach persons who may be affected.  Proclamations under this subsection shall remain in force until rescinded following the same procedure established for enactment.


(g) If a season is open permitting such method of taking for the species in question, a hunter may take rabbits, squirrels, opossum, raccoons, fur-bearing animals, and nongame animals and birds open to hunting with a pistol.  In addition, a hunter or trapper lawfully taking a wild animal or wild bird by another lawful method may use a knife, pistol, or other swift method of killing the animal or bird taken.  The Wildlife Resources Commission may, however, restrict or prohibit the carrying of firearms during special seasons or in special areas reserved for the taking of wildlife with primitive weapons or other restricted methods.


(g1) The Wildlife Resources Commission may by rule prescribe the types of handguns and handgun ammunition that may be used in taking big game animals other than wild turkey.  During the regular gun seasons for taking bear, deer and wild boar these animals may be taken with types of handguns and handgun ammunition that shall be approved for such use by the rules of the Wildlife Resources Commission.  The Commission shall not provide any special season for the exclusive use of handguns in taking wildlife.


(h) In the interests of enhancing the enjoyment of sportsmen, and if consistent with conservation objectives, the Wildlife Resources Commission may by rule relax requirements of this section on controlled shooting preserves and in other highly controlled situations.


(i) The intentional destruction or substantial impairment of wildlife nesting or breeding areas or other purposeful acts to render them unfit is unlawful.  These prohibitions include cutting down den trees, shooting into nests of wild animals or birds, and despoliation of dens, nests, or rookeries.


(j) It is unlawful to take deer swimming or in water above the knees of the deer.


(k) If a hunter kills or wounds a big game animal during the hunting hours authorized by subsection (a) of this section, the hunter may use a portable light source and a single dog on a leash to assist the hunter in retrieving the dead or wounded big game animal, and may dispatch a wounded big game animal using only a .22-caliber rimfire pistol, archery equipment, or a handgun otherwise legal for that hunting season.  Pursuit and retrieval under this subsection may occur between the hours of one-half hour after sunset and 11:00 p.m. if necessary, but such pursuit and retrieval may not be accomplished using a motorized vehicle.
For purposes of this section, the term “dispatch” means the quick and humane killing of a wounded animal to prevent further suffering through infection, starvation, or other distress in the wild.

Coercing dealer to accept commodities not ordered;  threatening to cancel franchise;  preventing transfer of ownership;  granting additional franchises;  terminating franchises without good cause;  preventing family succession,https://codes.findlaw.com/nc/chapter-20-motor-vehicles/nc-gen-st-sect-20-305.html,"
(1) To require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any dealer to accept delivery of any motor vehicle or vehicles, parts or accessories therefor, or any other commodities, which shall not have been ordered by that dealer, or to accept delivery of any motor vehicle or vehicles which have been equipped in a manner other than as specified by the dealer.


(2) To require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any dealer to enter into any agreement with such manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch, or representative thereof, or do any other act unfair to such dealer, by threatening to cancel any franchise existing between such manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, or representative thereof, and such dealer;


(3) Unfairly without due regard to the equities of the dealer, and without just provocation, to cancel the franchise of such dealer;


(4) Notwithstanding the terms of any franchise agreement, to prevent or refuse to approve the sale or transfer of the ownership of a dealership by the sale of the business, stock transfer, or otherwise, or the transfer, sale or assignment of a dealer franchise, or a change in the executive management or principal operator of the dealership, change in use of an existing facility to provide for the sales or service of one or more additional line-makes of new motor vehicles, or relocation of the dealership to another site within the dealership's relevant market area, if the Commissioner has determined, if requested in writing by the dealer within 30 days after receipt of an objection to the proposed transfer, sale, assignment, relocation, or change, and after a hearing on the matter, that the failure to permit or honor the transfer, sale, assignment, relocation, or change is unreasonable under the circumstances.  No franchise may be transferred, sold, assigned, relocated, or the executive management or principal operators changed, or the use of an existing facility changed, unless the franchisor has been given at least 30 days' prior written notice as to the proposed transferee's name and address, financial ability, and qualifications of the proposed transferee, a copy of the purchase agreement between the dealership and the proposed transferee, the identity and qualifications of the persons proposed to be involved in executive management or as principal operators, and the location and site plans of any proposed relocation or change in use of a dealership facility.  The franchisor shall send the dealership and the proposed transferee notice of objection, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the proposed transfer, sale, assignment, relocation, or change within 30 days after receipt of notice from the dealer, as provided in this section.  The notice of objection shall state in detail all factual and legal bases for the objection on the part of the franchisor to the proposed transfer, sale, assignment, relocation, or change that is specifically referenced in this subdivision.  An objection to a proposed transfer, sale, assignment, relocation, or change in the executive management or principal operator of the dealership or change in the use of the facility may only be premised upon the factual and legal bases specifically referenced in this subdivision or 
G.S. 20-305(11)
, as it relates to change in the use of a facility.  A manufacturer's notice of objection which is based upon factual or legal issues that are not specifically referenced in this subdivision or 
G.S. 20-305(11)
 with respect to a change in the use of an existing facility as being issues upon which the Commissioner shall base his determination shall not be effective to preserve the franchisor's right to object to the proposed transfer sale, assignment, relocation, or change, provided the dealership or proposed transferee has submitted written notice, as required above, as to the proposed transferee's name and address, financial ability, and qualifications of the proposed transferee, a copy of the purchase agreement between the dealership and the proposed transferee, the identity and qualifications of the persons proposed to be involved in the executive management or as principal operators, and the location and site plans of any proposed relocation or change in the use of an existing facility.  Failure by the franchisor to send notice of objection within 30 days shall constitute waiver by the franchisor of any right to object to the proposed transfer, sale, assignment, relocation, or change.  If the franchisor requires additional information to complete its review, the franchisor shall notify the dealership within 15 days after receipt of the proposed transferee's name and address, financial ability, and qualifications, a copy of the purchase agreement between the dealership and the proposed transferee, the identity and qualifications of the persons proposed to be involved in executive management or as principal operators, and the location and site plans of any proposed relocation or change in use of the dealership facility.  If the franchisor fails to request additional information from the dealer or proposed transferee within 15 days of receipt of this initial information, the 30-day time period within which the franchisor may provide notice of objection shall be deemed to run from the initial receipt date.  Otherwise, the 30-day time period within which the franchisor may provide notice of objection shall run from the date the franchisor has received the supplemental information requested from the dealer or proposed transferee;  provided, however, that failure by the franchisor to send notice of objection within 60 days of the franchisor's receipt of the initial information from the dealer shall constitute waiver by the franchisor of any right to object to the proposed transfer, sale, assignment, relocation, or change.  With respect to a proposed transfer of ownership, sale, or assignment, the sole issue for determination by the Commissioner and the sole issue upon which the Commissioner shall hear or consider evidence is whether, by reason of lack of good moral character, lack of general business experience, or lack of financial ability, the proposed transferee is unfit to own the dealership.  For purposes of this subdivision, the refusal by the manufacturer to accept a proposed transferee who is of good moral character and who otherwise meets the written, reasonable, and uniformly applied business experience and financial requirements, if any, required by the manufacturer of owners of its franchised automobile dealerships is presumed to demonstrate the manufacturer's failure to prove that the proposed transferee is unfit to own the dealership.  With respect to a proposed change in the executive management or principal operator of the dealership, the sole issue for determination by the Commissioner and the sole issue on which the Commissioner shall hear or consider evidence shall be whether, by reason of lack of training, lack of prior experience, poor past performance, or poor character, the proposed candidate for a position within the executive management or as principal operator of the dealership is unfit for the position.  For purposes of this subdivision, the refusal by the manufacturer to accept a proposed candidate for executive management or as principal operator who is of good moral character and who otherwise meets the written, reasonable, and uniformly applied standards or qualifications, if any, of the manufacturer relating to the business experience and prior performance of executive management required by the manufacturers of its dealers is presumed to demonstrate the manufacturer's failure to prove the proposed candidate for executive management or as principal operator is unfit to serve the capacity.  With respect to a proposed change in use of a dealership facility to provide for the sales or service of one or more additional line-makes of new motor vehicles, the sole issue for determination by the Commissioner is whether the new motor vehicle dealer has a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of motor vehicle and remains in compliance with any reasonable capital standards and facilities requirements of the manufacturer or distributor.  The reasonable facilities requirements of the manufacturer or distributor shall not include any requirement that a new motor vehicle dealer establish or maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or display space.  With respect to a proposed relocation or other proposed change, the issue for determination by the Commissioner is whether the proposed relocation or other change is unreasonable under the circumstances.  For purposes of this subdivision, the refusal by the manufacturer to agree to a proposed relocation which meets the written, reasonable, and uniformly applied standards or criteria, if any, of the manufacturer relating to dealer relocations is presumed to demonstrate that the manufacturer's failure to prove the proposed relocation is unreasonable under the circumstances.  The manufacturer shall have the burden of proof before the Commissioner under this subdivision.  It is unlawful for a manufacturer to, in any way, condition its approval of a proposed transfer, sale, assignment, change in the dealer's executive management, principal operator, or appointment of a designated successor, on the existing or proposed dealer's willingness to construct a new facility, renovate the existing facility, acquire or refrain from acquiring one or more line-makes of vehicles, separate or divest one or more line-makes of vehicle, or establish or maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or display space.  It is unlawful for a manufacturer to, in any way, condition its approval of a proposed relocation on the existing or proposed dealer's willingness to acquire or refrain from acquiring one or more line-makes of vehicles, separate or divest one or more line-makes of vehicle, or establish or maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or display space.  The opinion or determination of a franchisor that the continued existence of one of its franchised dealers situated in this State is not viable, or that the dealer holds or fails to hold licensing rights for the sale of other line-makes of vehicles in a manner consistent with the franchisor's existing or future distribution or marketing plans, shall not constitute a lawful basis for the franchisor to fail or refuse to approve a dealer's proposed change in use of a dealership facility or relocation:  provided, however, that nothing contained in this subdivision shall be deemed to prevent or prohibit a franchisor from failing to approve a dealer's proposed relocation on grounds that the specific site or facility proposed by the dealer is otherwise unreasonable under the circumstances.  Approval of a relocation pursuant to this subdivision shall not in itself constitute the franchisor's representation or assurance of the dealer's viability at that location.


(5) To enter into a franchise establishing an additional new motor vehicle dealer or relocating an existing new motor vehicle dealer into a relevant market area where the same line make is then represented without first notifying in writing the Commissioner and each new motor vehicle dealer in that line make in the relevant market area of the intention to establish an additional dealer or to relocate an existing dealer within or into that market area.  Within 30 days of receiving such notice or within 30 days after the end of any appeal procedure provided by the manufacturer, any new motor vehicle dealer may file with the Commissioner a protest to the establishing or relocating of the new motor vehicle dealer.  When a protest is filed, the Commissioner shall promptly inform the manufacturer that a timely protest has been filed, and that the manufacturer shall not establish or relocate the proposed new motor vehicle dealer until the Commissioner has held a hearing and has determined that there is good cause for permitting the addition or relocation of such new motor vehicle dealer.

a. This section does not apply:

1. To the relocation of an existing new motor vehicle dealer within that dealer's relevant market area, provided that the relocation not be at a site within 10 miles of a licensed new motor vehicle dealer for the same line make of motor vehicle.  If this sub-subdivision is applicable, only dealers trading in the same line-make of vehicle that are located within the 10-mile radius shall be entitled to notice from the manufacturer and have the protest rights afforded under this section.


2. If the proposed additional new motor vehicle dealer is to be established at or within two miles of a location at which a former licensed new motor vehicle dealer for the same line make of new motor vehicle had ceased operating within the previous two years.


3. To the relocation of an existing new motor vehicle dealer within two miles of the existing site of the new motor vehicle dealership if the franchise has been operating on a regular basis from the existing site for a minimum of three years immediately preceding the relocation.


4. To the relocation of an existing new motor vehicle dealer if the proposed site of the relocated new motor vehicle dealership is further away from all other new motor vehicle dealers of the same line make in that relevant market area.

b. In determining whether good cause has been established for not entering into or relocating an additional new motor vehicle dealer for the same line make, the Commissioner shall take into consideration the existing circumstances, including, but not limited to:

1. The permanency of the investment of both the existing and proposed additional new motor vehicle dealers;


2. Growth or decline in population, density of population, and new car registrations in the relevant market area;


3. Effect on the consuming public in the relevant market area;


4. Whether it is injurious or beneficial to the public welfare for an additional new motor vehicle dealer to be established;


5. Whether the new motor vehicle dealers of the same line make in that relevant market area are providing adequate competition and convenient customer care for the motor vehicles of the same line make in the market area which shall include the adequacy of motor vehicle sales and service facilities, equipment, supply of motor vehicle parts, and qualified service personnel;


6. Whether the establishment of an additional new motor vehicle dealer or relocation of an existing new motor vehicle dealer in the relevant market area would increase competition in a manner such as to be in the long-term public interest;  and


7. The effect on the relocating dealer of a denial of its relocation into the relevant market area.



c. The Commissioner shall try to conduct the hearing and render his final determination if possible, within 180 days after a protest is filed.


d. Any parties to a hearing by the Commissioner concerning the establishment or relocating of a new motor vehicle dealer shall have a right of review of the decision in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Chapter 150B of the General Statutes.

, at which warranty service work authorized or reimbursed by a manufacturer is performed or at which new motor vehicles are offered for sale to the public, shall be considered an additional new motor vehicle dealer requiring a showing of good cause, prior notification to existing new motor vehicle dealers of the same line make of vehicle within the relevant market area by the manufacturer and the opportunity for a hearing before the Commissioner as provided in this subdivision.



a. This section does not apply:

1. To the relocation of an existing new motor vehicle dealer within that dealer's relevant market area, provided that the relocation not be at a site within 10 miles of a licensed new motor vehicle dealer for the same line make of motor vehicle.  If this sub-subdivision is applicable, only dealers trading in the same line-make of vehicle that are located within the 10-mile radius shall be entitled to notice from the manufacturer and have the protest rights afforded under this section.

(6) Notwithstanding the terms, provisions or conditions of any franchise or notwithstanding the terms or provisions of any waiver, to terminate, cancel or fail to renew any franchise with a licensed new motor vehicle dealer unless the manufacturer has satisfied the notice requirements of sub-subdivision c. of this subdivision and the Commissioner has determined, if requested in writing by the dealer within (i) the time period specified in 
G.S. 20-305(6)
c.1.II., III., or IV., as applicable, or (ii) the effective date of the franchise termination specified or proposed by the manufacturer in the notice of termination, whichever period of time is longer, and after a hearing on the matter, that there is good cause for the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal of the franchise and that the manufacturer has acted in good faith as defined in this act regarding the termination, cancellation or nonrenewal.  When such a petition is made to the Commissioner by a dealer for determination as to the existence of good cause and good faith for the termination, cancellation or nonrenewal of a franchise, the Commissioner shall promptly inform the manufacturer that a timely petition has been filed, and the franchise in question shall continue in effect pending the Commissioner's decision.  The Commissioner shall try to conduct the hearing and render a final determination within 180 days after a petition has been filed.  If the termination, cancellation or nonrenewal is pursuant to

G.S. 1A-1, Rule 65(d) and (e)

1. There is a failure by the new motor vehicle dealer to comply with a provision of the franchise which provision is both reasonable and of material significance to the franchise relationship provided that the dealer has been notified in writing of the failure within 180 days after the manufacturer first acquired knowledge of such failure;


2. If the failure by the new motor vehicle dealer relates to the performance of the new motor vehicle dealer in sales or service, then good cause shall be defined as the failure of the new motor vehicle dealer to comply with reasonable performance criteria established by the manufacturer if the new motor vehicle dealer was apprised by the manufacturer in writing of the failure;  and

I. The notification stated that notice was provided of failure of performance pursuant to this section;


II. The new motor vehicle dealer was afforded a reasonable opportunity, for a period of not less than 180 days, to comply with the criteria;  and


III. The new motor vehicle dealer failed to demonstrate substantial progress towards compliance with the manufacturer's performance criteria during such period and the new motor vehicle dealer's failure was not primarily due to economic or market factors within the dealer's relevant market area which were beyond the dealer's control.




b. The manufacturer shall have the burden of proof under this section.


c. Notification of Termination, Cancellation and Nonrenewal. --

1. Notwithstanding the terms, provisions or conditions of any franchise prior to the termination, cancellation or nonrenewal of any franchise, the manufacturer shall furnish notification of termination, cancellation or nonrenewal to the new motor vehicle dealer as follows:

I. Each new and unsold motor vehicle within the new motor vehicle dealer's inventory that has been acquired within 24 months of the effective date of the termination from the manufacturer or distributor or another same line-make dealer in the ordinary course of business, and which has not been substantially altered or damaged to the prejudice of the manufacturer or distributor while in the new motor vehicle dealer's possession, and which has been driven less than 1,000 miles or, for purposes of a recreational vehicle motor home as defined in 
G.S. 20-4.01(32b)
a., less than 1,500 miles following the original date of delivery to the dealer, and for which no certificate of title has been issued.  For purposes of this sub-subdivision, the term “ordinary course of business” shall include inventory transfers of all new, same line-make vehicles between affiliated dealerships, or otherwise between dealerships having common or interrelated ownership, provided that the transfer is not intended solely for the purpose of benefiting from the termination assistance described in this sub-subdivision.


II. Unused, undamaged and unsold supplies and parts purchased from the manufacturer or distributor or sources approved by the manufacturer or distributor, at a price not to exceed the original manufacturer's price to the dealer, provided such supplies and parts are currently offered for sale by the manufacturer or distributor in its current parts catalogs and are in salable condition.


III. Equipment, signs, and furnishings that have not been substantially altered or damaged and that have been required by the manufacturer or distributor to be purchased by the new motor vehicle dealer from the manufacturer or distributor, or their approved sources.


IV. Special tools that have not been altered or damaged, normal wear and tear excepted, and that have been required by the manufacturer or distributor to be purchased by the new motor vehicle dealer from the manufacturer or distributor, or their approved sources within five years immediately preceding the termination, nonrenewal or cancellation of the franchise.  The amount of compensation which shall be paid to the new motor vehicle dealer by the manufacturer or distributor shall be the net acquisition price if the item was acquired in the 12 months preceding the date of receipt of the dealer's request for compensation;  seventy-five percent (75%) of the net acquisition price if the item was acquired between 13 and 24 months preceding the dealer's request for compensation;  fifty percent (50%) of the net acquisition price if the item was acquired between 25 and 36 months preceding the dealer's request for compensation;  twenty-five percent (25%) of the net acquisition price if the item was acquired between 37 and 60 months preceding the dealer's request for compensation.



2. The compensation provided above shall be paid by the manufacturer or distributor not later than 90 days after the manufacturer or distributor has received notice in writing from or on behalf of the new motor vehicle dealer specifying the elements of compensation requested by the dealer;  provided the new motor vehicle dealer has, or can obtain, clear title to the inventory and has conveyed, or can convey, title and possession of the same to the manufacturer or distributor.  Within 15 days after receipt of the dealer's written request for compensation, the manufacturer or distributor shall send the dealer detailed written instructions and forms required by the manufacturer or distributor to effectuate the receipt of the compensation requested by the dealer.  The manufacturer or distributor shall be obligated to pay or reimburse the dealer for any transportation charges associated with the repurchase obligations of the manufacturer or distributor under this sub-subdivision.  The manufacturer or distributor shall also compensate the dealer for any handling, packing, or similar payments contemplated in the franchise.  In no event may the manufacturer or distributor charge the dealer any handling, restocking, or other similar costs or fees associated with items repurchased by the manufacturer under this sub-subdivision.


3. In addition to the other payments set forth in this section, if a termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal is premised upon any of the occurrences set forth in 
G.S. 20-305(6)

e. Dealership Facilities Assistance upon Termination, Cancellation or Nonrenewal.
In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in 
G.S. 20-305(6)
d.1. above, except termination, cancellation or nonrenewal for license revocation, conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, or fraud by a dealer-owner:

1. Subject to sub-sub-subdivision 3. of this sub-subdivision, if the new motor vehicle dealer is leasing the dealership facilities from a lessor other than the manufacturer or distributor, the manufacturer or distributor shall pay the new motor vehicle dealer a sum equivalent to the rent for the unexpired term of the lease or three year's rent, whichever is less, or such longer term as is provided in the franchise agreement between the dealer and manufacturer;  except that, in the case of motorcycle dealerships, the manufacturer shall pay the new motor vehicle dealer the sum equivalent to the rent for the unexpired term of the lease or one year's rent, whichever is less, or such longer term as provided in the franchise agreement between the dealer and manufacturer;  or


2. Subject to sub-sub-subdivision 3. of this sub-subdivision, if the new motor vehicle dealer owns the dealership facilities, the manufacturer or distributor shall pay the new motor vehicle dealer a sum equivalent to the reasonable rental value of the dealership facilities for three years, or for one year in the case of motorcycle dealerships.


3. In order to be entitled to facilities assistance from the manufacturer or distributor, as provided in this sub-subdivision, the dealer, owner, or lessee, as the case may be, shall have the obligation to mitigate damages by listing the demised premises for lease or sublease with a licensed real estate agent within 30 days after the effective date of the termination of the franchise and thereafter by reasonably cooperating with said real estate agent in the performance of the agent's duties and responsibilities.  In the event that the dealer, owner, or lessee is able to lease or sublease the demised premises, the dealer shall be obligated to pay the manufacturer the net revenue received from such mitigation up to the total amount of facilities assistance which the dealer has received from the manufacturer pursuant to sub-subdivisions 1. and 2.  To the extent and for such uses and purposes as may be consistent with the terms of the lease, a manufacturer who pays facilities assistance to a dealer under this sub-subdivision shall be entitled to occupy and use the dealership facilities during the years for which the manufacturer shall have paid rent under sub-subdivisions 1. and 2.


4. In the event the termination relates to fewer than all of the franchises operated by the dealer at a single location, the amount of facilities assistance which the manufacturer or distributor is required to pay the dealer under this sub-subdivision shall be based on the proportion of gross revenue received from the sale and lease of new vehicles by the dealer and from the dealer's parts and service operations during the three years immediately preceding the effective date of the termination (or any shorter period that the dealer may have held these franchises) of the line-makes being terminated, in relation to the gross revenue received from the sale and lease of all line-makes of new vehicles by the dealer and from the total of the dealer's and parts and service operations from this location during the same three-year period.


5. The compensation required for facilities assistance under this sub-subdivision shall be paid by the manufacturer or distributor within 90 days after the manufacturer or distributor has received notice in writing from, or on behalf of, a new motor vehicle dealer specifying the elements of compensation requested by the dealer.



f. The provisions of sub-subdivision e. above shall not be applicable when the termination, nonrenewal, or cancellation of the franchise agreement by a new motor vehicle dealer is the result of the sale of assets or stock of the motor vehicle dealership.  The provisions of sub-subdivisions d. and e. above shall not be applicable when the termination, nonrenewal, or cancellation of the franchise agreement is at the initiation of a new motor vehicle dealer of recreational vehicle motor homes, as defined in 
G.S. 20-4.01(32b)
a., provided that at the time of the termination, nonrenewal, or cancellation, the recreational vehicle manufacturer or distributor has paid to the dealer all claims for warranty or recall work, including payments for labor, parts, and other expenses, which were submitted by the dealer 30 days or more prior to the date of termination, nonrenewal, or cancellation.


g. A franchise shall continue in full force and operation notwithstanding a change, in whole or in part, of an established plan or system of distribution of the motor vehicles offered for sale under the franchise.  The appointment of a new manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch for motor vehicles offered for sale under the franchise agreement shall be deemed to be a change of an established plan or system of distribution.
Upon the occurrence of the change, the Division shall deny an application of a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch for a license or license renewal unless the applicant for a license as a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch offers to each motor vehicle dealer who is a party to a franchise for that line-make a new franchise agreement containing substantially the same provisions which were contained in the previous franchise agreement or files an affidavit with the Division acknowledging its undertaking to assume and fulfill the rights, duties, and obligations of its predecessor under the previous franchise agreement.



a. Notwithstanding the terms, provisions or conditions of any franchise or the terms or provisions of any waiver, good cause shall exist for the purposes of a termination, cancellation or nonrenewal when:

1. There is a failure by the new motor vehicle dealer to comply with a provision of the franchise which provision is both reasonable and of material significance to the franchise relationship provided that the dealer has been notified in writing of the failure within 180 days after the manufacturer first acquired knowledge of such failure;


2. If the failure by the new motor vehicle dealer relates to the performance of the new motor vehicle dealer in sales or service, then good cause shall be defined as the failure of the new motor vehicle dealer to comply with reasonable performance criteria established by the manufacturer if the new motor vehicle dealer was apprised by the manufacturer in writing of the failure;  and

I. The notification stated that notice was provided of failure of performance pursuant to this section;


II. The new motor vehicle dealer was afforded a reasonable opportunity, for a period of not less than 180 days, to comply with the criteria;  and


III. The new motor vehicle dealer failed to demonstrate substantial progress towards compliance with the manufacturer's performance criteria during such period and the new motor vehicle dealer's failure was not primarily due to economic or market factors within the dealer's relevant market area which were beyond the dealer's control.




1. There is a failure by the new motor vehicle dealer to comply with a provision of the franchise which provision is both reasonable and of material significance to the franchise relationship provided that the dealer has been notified in writing of the failure within 180 days after the manufacturer first acquired knowledge of such failure;


2. If the failure by the new motor vehicle dealer relates to the performance of the new motor vehicle dealer in sales or service, then good cause shall be defined as the failure of the new motor vehicle dealer to comply with reasonable performance criteria established by the manufacturer if the new motor vehicle dealer was apprised by the manufacturer in writing of the failure;  and

I. The notification stated that notice was provided of failure of performance pursuant to this section;

4. In the event the termination relates to fewer than all of the franchises operated by the dealer at a single location, the amount of facilities assistance which the manufacturer or distributor is required to pay the dealer under this sub-subdivision shall be based on the proportion of gross revenue received from the sale and lease of new vehicles by the dealer and from the dealer's parts and service operations during the three years immediately preceding the effective date of the termination (or any shorter period that the dealer may have held these franchises) of the line-makes being terminated, in relation to the gross revenue received from the sale and lease of all line-makes of new vehicles by the dealer and from the total of the dealer's and parts and service operations from this location during the same three-year period.

G.S. 20-4.01(32b)
a., provided that at the time of the termination, nonrenewal, or cancellation, the recreational vehicle manufacturer or distributor has paid to the dealer all claims for warranty or recall work, including payments for labor, parts, and other expenses, which were submitted by the dealer 30 days or more prior to the date of termination, nonrenewal, or cancellation.

Upon the occurrence of the change, the Division shall deny an application of a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch for a license or license renewal unless the applicant for a license as a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch offers to each motor vehicle dealer who is a party to a franchise for that line-make a new franchise agreement containing substantially the same provisions which were contained in the previous franchise agreement or files an affidavit with the Division acknowledging its undertaking to assume and fulfill the rights, duties, and obligations of its predecessor under the previous franchise agreement.


(7) Notwithstanding the terms of any contract or agreement, to prevent or refuse to honor the succession to a dealership, including the franchise, by a motor vehicle dealer's designated successor as provided for under this subsection.

a. Any owner of a new motor vehicle dealership may appoint by will, or any other written instrument, a designated successor to succeed in the respective ownership interest or interest as principal operator of the owner in the new motor vehicle dealership, including the franchise, upon the death or incapacity of the owner or principal operator.  In order for succession to the position of principal operator to occur by operation of law in accordance with sub-subdivision c. below, the owner's choice of a successor must be approved by the dealer, in accordance with the dealer's bylaws, if applicable, either prior or subsequent to the death or incapacity of the existing principal operator.


b. Any objections by a manufacturer or distributor to an owner's appointment of a designated successor shall be asserted in accordance with the following procedure:

1. Within 30 days after receiving written notice of the identity of the owner's designated successor and general information as to the financial ability and qualifications of the designated successor, the franchisor shall send the owner and designated successor notice of objection, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the appointment of the designated successor.  The notice of objection shall state in detail all facts which constitute the basis for the contention on the part of the manufacturer or distributor that good cause, as defined in this sub-subdivision below, exists for rejection of the designated successor.  Failure by the franchisor to send notice of objection within 30 days and otherwise as provided in this sub-subdivision shall constitute waiver by the franchisor of any right to object to the appointment of the designated successor.


2. Any time within 30 days of receipt of the manufacturer's notice of objection the owner or the designated successor may file a request in writing with the Commissioner that the Commissioner hold an evidentiary hearing and determine whether good cause exists for rejection of the designated successor.  When such a request is filed, the Commissioner shall promptly inform the affected manufacturer or distributor that a timely request has been filed.


3. The Commissioner shall endeavor to hold the evidentiary hearing required under this sub-subdivision and render a determination within 180 days after receipt of the written request from the owner or designated successor.  In determining whether good cause exists for rejection of the owner's appointed designated successor, the manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proving that the designated successor is a person who is not of good moral character or does not meet the franchisor's existing written and reasonable standards and, considering the volume of sales and service of the new motor vehicle dealer, uniformly applied minimum business experience standards in the market area.


4. Any parties to a hearing by the Commissioner concerning whether good cause exists for the rejection of the dealer's designated successor shall have a right of review of the decision in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Chapter 150B of the General Statutes.


5. Nothing in this sub-subdivision shall preclude a manufacturer or distributor from, upon its receipt of written notice from an owner of the identity of the owner's designated successor, requiring that the designated successor promptly provide personal and financial data that is reasonably necessary to determine the financial ability and qualifications of the designated successor;  provided, however, that such a request for additional information shall not delay any of the time periods or constraints contained herein.


6. In the event death or incapacity of the owner or principal operator occurs prior to the time a manufacturer or distributor receives notice of the owner's appointment of a designated successor or before the Commissioner has rendered a determination as provided above, the existing franchise shall remain in effect and the designated successor shall be deemed to have succeeded to all of the owner's or principal operator's rights and obligations in the dealership and under the franchise until a determination is made by the Commissioner or the rights of the parties have otherwise become fixed in accordance with this sub-subdivision.



c. Except as otherwise provided in sub-subdivision d. of this subdivision, any designated successor of a deceased or incapacitated owner or principal operator of a new motor vehicle dealership appointed by such owner in substantial compliance with this section shall, by operation of law, succeed at the time of such death or incapacity to all of the rights and obligations of the owner or principal operator in the new motor vehicle dealership and under either the existing franchise or any other successor, renewal, or replacement franchise.


d. Within 60 days after the death or incapacity of the owner or principal operator, a designated successor appointed in substantial compliance with this section shall give the affected manufacturer or distributor written notice of his or her succession to the position of owner or principal operator of the new motor vehicle dealership;  provided, however, that the failure of the designated successor to give the manufacturer or distributor written notice as provided above within 60 days of the death or incapacity of the owner or principal operator shall not result in the waiver or termination of the designated successor's right to succeed to the ownership of the new motor vehicle dealership unless the manufacturer or distributor gives written notice of this provision to either the designated successor or the deceased or incapacitated owner's executor, administrator, guardian or other fiduciary by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and said written notice grants not less than 30 days time within which the designated successor may give the notice required hereunder, provided the designated successor or the deceased or incapacitated owner's executor, administrator, guardian or other fiduciary has given the manufacturer reasonable notice of death or incapacity.  Within 30 days of receipt of the notice by the manufacturer or distributor from the designated successor provided in this sub-subdivision, the manufacturer or distributor may request that the designated successor complete the application forms generally utilized by the manufacturer or distributor to review the designated successor's qualifications to establish a successor dealership.  Within 30 days of receipt of the completed forms, the manufacturer or distributor shall send a letter by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, advising the designated successor of facts and circumstances which have changed since the manufacturer's or distributor's original approval of the designated successor, and which have caused the manufacturer or distributor to object to the designated successor.  Upon receipt of such notice, the designated successor may either designate an alternative successor or may file a request for evidentiary hearing in accordance with the procedures provided in sub-subdivisions b.2.-5. of this subdivision.  In any such hearing, the manufacturer or distributor shall be limited to facts and circumstances which did not exist at the time the designated successor was originally approved or evidence which was originally requested to be produced by the designated successor at the time of the original request and was fraudulent.


e. The designated successor shall agree to be bound by all terms and conditions of the franchise in effect between the manufacturer or distributor and the owner at the time of the owner's or principal operator's death or incapacity, if so requested in writing by the manufacturer or distributor subsequent to the owner's or principal operator's death or incapacity.


f. This section does not preclude an owner of a new motor vehicle dealership from designating any person as his or her successor by written instrument filed with the manufacturer or distributor, and, in the event there is an inconsistency between the successor named in such written instrument and the designated successor otherwise appointed by the owner consistent with the provisions of this section, and that written instrument has not been revoked by the owner of the new motor vehicle dealership in writing to the manufacturer or distributor, then the written instrument filed with the manufacturer or distributor shall govern as to the appointment of the successor.



a. Any owner of a new motor vehicle dealership may appoint by will, or any other written instrument, a designated successor to succeed in the respective ownership interest or interest as principal operator of the owner in the new motor vehicle dealership, including the franchise, upon the death or incapacity of the owner or principal operator.  In order for succession to the position of principal operator to occur by operation of law in accordance with sub-subdivision c. below, the owner's choice of a successor must be approved by the dealer, in accordance with the dealer's bylaws, if applicable, either prior or subsequent to the death or incapacity of the existing principal operator.


b. Any objections by a manufacturer or distributor to an owner's appointment of a designated successor shall be asserted in accordance with the following procedure:

1. Within 30 days after receiving written notice of the identity of the owner's designated successor and general information as to the financial ability and qualifications of the designated successor, the franchisor shall send the owner and designated successor notice of objection, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the appointment of the designated successor.  The notice of objection shall state in detail all facts which constitute the basis for the contention on the part of the manufacturer or distributor that good cause, as defined in this sub-subdivision below, exists for rejection of the designated successor.  Failure by the franchisor to send notice of objection within 30 days and otherwise as provided in this sub-subdivision shall constitute waiver by the franchisor of any right to object to the appointment of the designated successor.


2. Any time within 30 days of receipt of the manufacturer's notice of objection the owner or the designated successor may file a request in writing with the Commissioner that the Commissioner hold an evidentiary hearing and determine whether good cause exists for rejection of the designated successor.  When such a request is filed, the Commissioner shall promptly inform the affected manufacturer or distributor that a timely request has been filed.


3. The Commissioner shall endeavor to hold the evidentiary hearing required under this sub-subdivision and render a determination within 180 days after receipt of the written request from the owner or designated successor.  In determining whether good cause exists for rejection of the owner's appointed designated successor, the manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proving that the designated successor is a person who is not of good moral character or does not meet the franchisor's existing written and reasonable standards and, considering the volume of sales and service of the new motor vehicle dealer, uniformly applied minimum business experience standards in the market area.


4. Any parties to a hearing by the Commissioner concerning whether good cause exists for the rejection of the dealer's designated successor shall have a right of review of the decision in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Chapter 150B of the General Statutes.


5. Nothing in this sub-subdivision shall preclude a manufacturer or distributor from, upon its receipt of written notice from an owner of the identity of the owner's designated successor, requiring that the designated successor promptly provide personal and financial data that is reasonably necessary to determine the financial ability and qualifications of the designated successor;  provided, however, that such a request for additional information shall not delay any of the time periods or constraints contained herein.


6. In the event death or incapacity of the owner or principal operator occurs prior to the time a manufacturer or distributor receives notice of the owner's appointment of a designated successor or before the Commissioner has rendered a determination as provided above, the existing franchise shall remain in effect and the designated successor shall be deemed to have succeeded to all of the owner's or principal operator's rights and obligations in the dealership and under the franchise until a determination is made by the Commissioner or the rights of the parties have otherwise become fixed in accordance with this sub-subdivision.



1. Within 30 days after receiving written notice of the identity of the owner's designated successor and general information as to the financial ability and qualifications of the designated successor, the franchisor shall send the owner and designated successor notice of objection, by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the appointment of the designated successor.  The notice of objection shall state in detail all facts which constitute the basis for the contention on the part of the manufacturer or distributor that good cause, as defined in this sub-subdivision below, exists for rejection of the designated successor.  Failure by the franchisor to send notice of objection within 30 days and otherwise as provided in this sub-subdivision shall constitute waiver by the franchisor of any right to object to the appointment of the designated successor.


2. Any time within 30 days of receipt of the manufacturer's notice of objection the owner or the designated successor may file a request in writing with the Commissioner that the Commissioner hold an evidentiary hearing and determine whether good cause exists for rejection of the designated successor.  When such a request is filed, the Commissioner shall promptly inform the affected manufacturer or distributor that a timely request has been filed.


3. The Commissioner shall endeavor to hold the evidentiary hearing required under this sub-subdivision and render a determination within 180 days after receipt of the written request from the owner or designated successor.  In determining whether good cause exists for rejection of the owner's appointed designated successor, the manufacturer or distributor has the burden of proving that the designated successor is a person who is not of good moral character or does not meet the franchisor's existing written and reasonable standards and, considering the volume of sales and service of the new motor vehicle dealer, uniformly applied minimum business experience standards in the market area.


4. Any parties to a hearing by the Commissioner concerning whether good cause exists for the rejection of the dealer's designated successor shall have a right of review of the decision in a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Chapter 150B of the General Statutes.


5. Nothing in this sub-subdivision shall preclude a manufacturer or distributor from, upon its receipt of written notice from an owner of the identity of the owner's designated successor, requiring that the designated successor promptly provide personal and financial data that is reasonably necessary to determine the financial ability and qualifications of the designated successor;  provided, however, that such a request for additional information shall not delay any of the time periods or constraints contained herein.


6. In the event death or incapacity of the owner or principal operator occurs prior to the time a manufacturer or distributor receives notice of the owner's appointment of a designated successor or before the Commissioner has rendered a determination as provided above, the existing franchise shall remain in effect and the designated successor shall be deemed to have succeeded to all of the owner's or principal operator's rights and obligations in the dealership and under the franchise until a determination is made by the Commissioner or the rights of the parties have otherwise become fixed in accordance with this sub-subdivision.


c. Except as otherwise provided in sub-subdivision d. of this subdivision, any designated successor of a deceased or incapacitated owner or principal operator of a new motor vehicle dealership appointed by such owner in substantial compliance with this section shall, by operation of law, succeed at the time of such death or incapacity to all of the rights and obligations of the owner or principal operator in the new motor vehicle dealership and under either the existing franchise or any other successor, renewal, or replacement franchise.


d. Within 60 days after the death or incapacity of the owner or principal operator, a designated successor appointed in substantial compliance with this section shall give the affected manufacturer or distributor written notice of his or her succession to the position of owner or principal operator of the new motor vehicle dealership;  provided, however, that the failure of the designated successor to give the manufacturer or distributor written notice as provided above within 60 days of the death or incapacity of the owner or principal operator shall not result in the waiver or termination of the designated successor's right to succeed to the ownership of the new motor vehicle dealership unless the manufacturer or distributor gives written notice of this provision to either the designated successor or the deceased or incapacitated owner's executor, administrator, guardian or other fiduciary by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and said written notice grants not less than 30 days time within which the designated successor may give the notice required hereunder, provided the designated successor or the deceased or incapacitated owner's executor, administrator, guardian or other fiduciary has given the manufacturer reasonable notice of death or incapacity.  Within 30 days of receipt of the notice by the manufacturer or distributor from the designated successor provided in this sub-subdivision, the manufacturer or distributor may request that the designated successor complete the application forms generally utilized by the manufacturer or distributor to review the designated successor's qualifications to establish a successor dealership.  Within 30 days of receipt of the completed forms, the manufacturer or distributor shall send a letter by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, advising the designated successor of facts and circumstances which have changed since the manufacturer's or distributor's original approval of the designated successor, and which have caused the manufacturer or distributor to object to the designated successor.  Upon receipt of such notice, the designated successor may either designate an alternative successor or may file a request for evidentiary hearing in accordance with the procedures provided in sub-subdivisions b.2.-5. of this subdivision.  In any such hearing, the manufacturer or distributor shall be limited to facts and circumstances which did not exist at the time the designated successor was originally approved or evidence which was originally requested to be produced by the designated successor at the time of the original request and was fraudulent.


e. The designated successor shall agree to be bound by all terms and conditions of the franchise in effect between the manufacturer or distributor and the owner at the time of the owner's or principal operator's death or incapacity, if so requested in writing by the manufacturer or distributor subsequent to the owner's or principal operator's death or incapacity.


f. This section does not preclude an owner of a new motor vehicle dealership from designating any person as his or her successor by written instrument filed with the manufacturer or distributor, and, in the event there is an inconsistency between the successor named in such written instrument and the designated successor otherwise appointed by the owner consistent with the provisions of this section, and that written instrument has not been revoked by the owner of the new motor vehicle dealership in writing to the manufacturer or distributor, then the written instrument filed with the manufacturer or distributor shall govern as to the appointment of the successor.


(8) To require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer in this State to order or accept delivery of any new motor vehicle with special features, accessories or equipment not included in the list price of those motor vehicles as publicly advertised by the manufacturer or distributor.


(9) To require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer in this State to purchase nondiagnostic computer equipment or programs, to participate monetarily in an advertising campaign or contest, or to purchase unnecessary or unreasonable quantities of any promotional materials, training materials, training programs, showroom or other display decorations, materials, computer equipment or programs, or special tools at the expense of the new motor vehicle dealer, provided that nothing in this subsection shall preclude a manufacturer or distributor from including an unitemized uniform charge in the base price of the new motor vehicle charged to the dealer where such charge is attributable to advertising costs incurred or to be incurred by the manufacturer or distributor in the ordinary courses of its business.


(10) To require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer in this State to change the capital structure of the new motor vehicle dealer or the means by or through which the new motor vehicle dealer finances the operation of the dealership provided that the new motor vehicle dealer at all times meets any reasonable capital standards determined by the manufacturer in accordance with uniformly applied criteria;  and also provided that no change in the capital structure shall cause a change in the principal management or have the effect of a sale of the franchise without the consent of the manufacturer or distributor, provided that said consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.


(11) To require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer in this State to refrain from participation in the management of, investment in, or the acquisition of any other line of new motor vehicle or related products;  Provided, however, that this subsection does not apply unless the new motor vehicle dealer maintains a reasonable line of credit for each make or line of new motor vehicle, and the new motor vehicle dealer remains in compliance with any reasonable capital standards and facilities requirements of the manufacturer.  The reasonable facilities requirements shall not include any requirement that a new motor vehicle dealer establish or maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or display space.


(12) To require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer in this State to change location of the dealership, or to make any substantial alterations to the dealership premises or facilities, when to do so would be unreasonable, or without written assurance of a sufficient supply of new motor vehicles so as to justify such an expansion, in light of the current market and economic conditions.


(13) To require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer in this State to prospectively assent to a release, assignment, novation, waiver or estoppel which would relieve any person from liability to be imposed by this law or to require any controversy between a new motor vehicle dealer and a manufacturer, distributor, or representative, to be referred to any person other than the duly constituted courts of the State or the United States of America, or to the Commissioner, if such referral would be binding upon the new motor vehicle dealer.


(14) To delay, refuse, or fail to deliver motor vehicles or motor vehicle parts or accessories in reasonable quantities relative to the new motor vehicle dealer's facilities and sales potential in the new motor vehicle dealer's market area as determined in accordance with reasonably applied economic principles, or within a reasonable time, after receipt of an order from a dealer having a franchise for the retail sale of any new motor vehicle sold or distributed by the manufacturer or distributor, any new vehicle, parts or accessories to new vehicles as are covered by such franchise, and such vehicles, parts or accessories as are publicly advertised as being available or actually being delivered.  The delivery to another dealer of a motor vehicle of the same model and similarly equipped as the vehicle ordered by a motor vehicle dealer who has not received delivery thereof, but who has placed his written order for the vehicle prior to the order of the dealer receiving the vehicle, shall be evidence of a delayed delivery of, or refusal to deliver, a new motor vehicle to a motor vehicle dealer within a reasonable time, without cause.  Additionally, except as may be required by any consent decree of the Commissioner or other order of the Commissioner or court of competent jurisdiction, any sales objectives which a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch establishes for any of its franchised dealers in this State must be reasonable, and every manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch must allocate its products within this State in a manner that does all of the following:

a. Provides each of its franchised dealers in this State an adequate supply of vehicles by series, product line, and model in a fair, reasonable, and equitable manner based on each dealer's historical selling pattern and reasonable sales standards as compared to other same line-make dealers in the State.


b. Allocates an adequate supply of vehicles to each of its dealers by series, product line, and model so as to allow the dealer to achieve any performance standards established by the manufacturer and distributor.


c. Is fair and equitable to all of its franchised dealers in this State.


d. Makes available to each of its franchised dealers in this State a minimum of one of each vehicle series, model, or product line that the manufacturer makes available to any dealer in this State and advertises in the State as being available for purchase.


e. Does not unfairly discriminate among its franchised dealers in its allocation process.

This subsection is not violated, however, if such failure is caused solely by the occurrence of temporary international, national, or regional product shortages resulting from natural disasters, unavailability of parts, labor strikes, product recalls, and other factors and events beyond the control of the manufacturer that temporarily reduce a manufacturer's product supply.  The willful or malicious maintenance, creation, or alteration of a vehicle allocation process or formula by a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch that is in any part designed or intended to force or coerce a dealer in this State to close or sell the dealer's franchise, cause the dealer financial distress, or to relocate, update, or renovate the dealer's existing dealership facility shall constitute an unfair and deceptive trade practice under 
G.S. 75-1.1
.


a. Provides each of its franchised dealers in this State an adequate supply of vehicles by series, product line, and model in a fair, reasonable, and equitable manner based on each dealer's historical selling pattern and reasonable sales standards as compared to other same line-make dealers in the State.

e. Does not unfairly discriminate among its franchised dealers in its allocation process.


(15) To refuse to disclose to any new motor vehicle dealer, handling the same line make, the manner and mode of distribution of that line make within the State.


(16) To award money, goods, services, or any other benefit to any new motor vehicle dealership employee, either directly or indirectly, unless such benefit is promptly accounted for, and transmitted to, or approved by, the new motor vehicle dealer.


(17) To increase prices of new motor vehicles which the new motor vehicle dealer had ordered and which the manufacturer or distributor has accepted for immediate delivery for private retail consumers prior to the new motor vehicle dealer's receipt of the written official price increase notification.  A sales contract signed by a private retail consumer shall constitute evidence of each such order provided that the vehicle is in fact delivered to that customer.  Price differences applicable to new model or series shall not be considered a price increase or price decrease.  Price changes caused by either:  (i) the addition to a new motor vehicle of required or optional equipment;  or (ii) revaluation of the United States dollar, in the case of foreign-make vehicles or components;  or (iii) an increase in transportation charges due to increased rates imposed by carriers;  or (iv) new tariffs or duties imposed by the United States of America or any other governmental authority, shall not be subject to the provisions of this subsection.


(18) To prevent or attempt to prevent a dealer from receiving fair and reasonable compensation for the value of the franchised business transferred in accordance with 
G.S. 20-305(4)
 above, or to prevent or attempt to prevent, through the exercise of any contractual right of first refusal or otherwise, a dealer located in this State from transferring the franchised business to such persons or other entities as the dealer shall designate in accordance with 
G.S. 20-305(4)
.  The opinion or determination of a manufacturer that the existence or location of one of its franchised dealers situated in this State is not viable or is not consistent with the manufacturer's distribution or marketing forecast or plans shall not constitute a lawful basis for the manufacturer to fail or refuse to approve a dealer's proposed transfer of ownership submitted in accordance with 
G.S. 20-305(4)
, or “good cause” for the termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal of the franchise under 
G.S. 20-305(6)
 or grounds for the objection to an owner's designated successor appointed pursuant to 
G.S. 20-305(7)
.


(19) To offer any refunds or other types of inducements to any person for the purchase of new motor vehicles of a certain line make to be sold to the State or any political subdivision thereof without making the same offer available upon request to all other new motor vehicle dealers in the same line make within the State.


(20) To release to any outside party, except under subpoena or as otherwise required by law or in an administrative, judicial or arbitration proceeding involving the manufacturer or new motor vehicle dealer, any confidential business, financial, or personal information which may be from time to time provided by the new motor vehicle dealer to the manufacturer, without the express written consent of the new motor vehicle dealer.


(21) To deny any new motor vehicle dealer the right of free association with any other new motor vehicle dealer for any lawful purpose.


(22) To unfairly discriminate among its new motor vehicle dealers with respect to warranty reimbursements or authority granted its new motor vehicle dealers to make warranty adjustments with retail customers.


(23) To engage in any predatory practice against or unfairly compete with a new motor vehicle dealer located in this State.


(24) To terminate any franchise solely because of the death or incapacity of an owner who is not listed in the franchise as one on whose expertise and abilities the manufacturer relied in the granting of the franchise.


(25) To require, coerce, or attempt to coerce a new motor vehicle dealer in this State to either establish or maintain exclusive facilities, personnel, or display space.


(26) To resort to or to use any false or misleading advertisement in the conducting of its business as a manufacturer or distributor in this State.


(27) To knowingly make, either directly or through any agent or employee, any material statement which is false or misleading or conceal any material facts which induce any new motor vehicle dealer to enter into any agreement or franchise or to take any action which is materially prejudicial to that new motor vehicle dealer or his business.


(28) To require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer to purchase or order any new motor vehicle as a precondition to purchasing, ordering, or receiving any other new motor vehicle or vehicles.  Nothing herein shall prevent a manufacturer from requiring that a new motor vehicle dealer fairly represent and inventory the full line of current model year new motor vehicles which are covered by the franchise agreement, provided that such inventory representation requirements are not unreasonable under the circumstances.


(29) To require, coerce, or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer to sell, transfer, or otherwise issue stock or other ownership interest in the dealership corporation to a general manager or any other person involved in the management of the dealership other than the dealer principal or dealer operator named in the franchise, unless the dealer principal or dealer operator is an absentee owner who is not involved in the operation of the dealership on a regular basis.


(30) To vary the price charged to any of its franchised new motor vehicle dealers located in this State for new motor vehicles based on the dealer's purchase of new facilities, supplies, tools, equipment, or other merchandise from the manufacturer, the dealer's relocation, remodeling, repair, or renovation of existing dealerships or construction of a new facility, the dealer's participation in training programs sponsored, endorsed, or recommended by the manufacturer, whether or not the dealer is dualed with one or more other line makes of new motor vehicles, or the dealer's sales penetration.  Except as provided in this subdivision, it shall be unlawful for any manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch, or any field representative, officer, agent, or any representative whatsoever of any of them to vary the price charged to any of its franchised new motor vehicle dealers located in this State for new motor vehicles based on the dealer's sales volume, the dealer's level of sales or customer service satisfaction, the dealer's purchase of advertising materials, signage, nondiagnostic computer hardware or software, communications devices, or furnishings, or the dealer's participation in used motor vehicle inspection or certification programs sponsored or endorsed by the manufacturer.
The price of the vehicle, for purposes of this subdivision shall include the manufacturer's use of rebates, credits, or other consideration that has the effect of causing a variance in the price of new motor vehicles offered to its franchised dealers located in the State.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this subdivision shall be deemed to preclude a manufacturer from establishing sales contests or promotions that provide or award dealers or consumers rebates or incentives;  provided, however, that the manufacturer complies with all of the following conditions:

a. With respect to manufacturer to consumer rebates and incentives, the manufacturer's criteria for determining eligibility shall:

1. Permit all of the manufacturer's franchised new motor vehicle dealers in this State to offer the rebate or incentive;  and


2. Be uniformly applied and administered to all eligible consumers.



b. With respect to manufacturer to dealer rebates and incentives, the rebate or incentive program shall:

1. Be based solely on the dealer's actual or reasonably anticipated sales volume or on a uniform per vehicle sold or leased basis;


2. Be uniformly available, applied, and administered to all of the manufacturer's franchised new motor vehicle dealers in this State;  and


3. Provide that any of the manufacturer's franchised new motor vehicle dealers in this State may, upon written request, obtain the method or formula used by the manufacturer in establishing the sales volumes for receiving the rebates or incentives and the specific calculations for determining the required sales volumes of the inquiring dealer and any of the manufacturer's other franchised new motor vehicle dealers located within 75 miles of the inquiring dealer.


Nothing contained in this subdivision shall prohibit a manufacturer from providing assistance or encouragement to a franchised dealer to remodel, renovate, recondition, or relocate the dealer's existing facilities, provided that this assistance, encouragement, or rewards are not determined on a per vehicle basis.
It is unlawful for any manufacturer to charge or include the cost of any program or policy prohibited under this subdivision in the price of new motor vehicles that the manufacturer sells to its franchised dealers or purchasers located in this State.
In the event that as of October 1, 1999, a manufacturer was operating a program that varied the price charged to its franchised dealers in this State in a manner that would violate this subdivision, or had in effect a documented policy that had been conveyed to its franchised dealers in this State and that varied the price charged to its franchised dealers in this State in a manner that would violate this subdivision, it shall be lawful for that program or policy, including amendments to that program or policy that are consistent with the purpose and provisions of the existing program or policy, or a program or policy similar thereto implemented after October 1, 1999, to continue in effect as to the manufacturer's franchised dealers located in this State until June 30, 2022.
In the event that as of June 30, 2001, a manufacturer was operating a program that varied the price charged to its franchised dealers in this State in a manner that would violate this subdivision, or had in effect a documented policy that had been conveyed to its franchised dealers in this State and that varied the price charged to its franchised dealers in this State in a manner that would violate this subdivision, and the program or policy was implemented in this State subsequent to October 1, 1999, and prior to June 30, 2001, and provided that the program or policy is in compliance with this subdivision as it existed as of June 30, 2001, it shall be lawful for that program or policy, including amendments to that program or policy that comply with this subdivision as it existed as of June 30, 2001, to continue in effect as to the manufacturer's franchised dealers located in this State until June 30, 2022.
Any manufacturer shall be required to pay or otherwise compensate any franchise dealer who has earned the right to receive payment or other compensation under a program in accordance with the manufacturer's program or policy.
The provisions of this subdivision shall not be applicable to multiple or repeated sales of new motor vehicles made by a new motor vehicle dealer to a single purchaser under a bona fide fleet sales policy of a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, or distributor branch.


a. With respect to manufacturer to consumer rebates and incentives, the manufacturer's criteria for determining eligibility shall:

(33) To fail to reimburse a dealer located in this State in full for the actual cost of providing a loaner vehicle to any customer who is having a vehicle serviced at the dealership if the provision of such a loaner vehicle is required by the manufacturer.

(a) The Division shall employ full-time resident inspectors for each commercial hazardous waste facility located within the State.  Such inspectors shall be employed and assigned so that at least one inspector is on duty at all times during which any component of the facility is in operation, is undergoing any maintenance or repair, or is undergoing any test or calibration.  Resident inspectors shall be assigned to commercial hazardous waste management facilities so as to protect the public health and the environment, to monitor all aspects of the operation of such facilities, and to assure compliance with all laws and rules administered by the Division and by any other division of the Department.  Such inspectors may also enforce laws or rules administered by any other agency of the State pursuant to an appropriate memorandum of agreement entered into by the Secretary and the chief administrative officer of such agency.  The Division may assign additional resident inspectors to a facility depending upon the quantity and toxicity of waste managed at a facility, diversity of types of waste managed at the facility, complexity of management technologies utilized at the facility, the range of components which are included at the facility, operating history of the facility, and other factors relative to the need for on-site inspection and enforcement capabilities.  The Division, in consultation with other divisions of the Department, shall define the duties of each resident inspector and shall determine whether additional resident inspectors are needed at a particular facility to meet the purposes of this section.


(b) The Division shall establish requirements pertaining to education, experience, and training for resident inspectors so as to assure that such inspectors are fully qualified to serve the purposes of this section.  The Division shall provide its resident inspectors with such training, equipment, facilities, and supplies as may be necessary to fulfill the purposes of this section.


(c) As a condition of its permit, the owner or operator of each commercial hazardous waste facility located within the State shall provide and maintain such appropriate and secure offices and laboratory facilities as the Department may require for the use of the resident inspectors required by this section.


(d) Resident inspectors assigned to a commercial hazardous waste facility shall have unrestricted access to all operational areas of such facility at all times.  For the protection of resident inspectors and the public, the provisions of 
G.S. 143-215.107(f)
 shall not apply to commercial hazardous waste facilities to which a resident inspector is assigned.


(e) No commercial hazardous waste facility shall be operated, undergo any maintenance or repair, or undergo any testing or calibration unless an inspector employed by the Division is present at the facility.


(f) The requirements of this section are intended to enhance the ability of the Department to protect the public health and the environment by providing the Department with the authority and resources necessary to maintain a rigorous inspection and enforcement program at commercial hazardous waste management facilities.  The requirements of this section are intended to be supplementary to other requirements imposed on hazardous waste facilities.  This section shall not be construed to relieve either the owner or the operator of any such facility or the Department from any other requirement of law or to require any unnecessary duplication of reporting or monitoring requirements.


(g) For the purpose of enforcing the laws and rules enacted or adopted for the protection of the public health and the environment, resident inspectors employed pursuant to this section may be commissioned as special peace officers as provided in 
G.S. 113-28.1
.  The provisions of Article 1A of Chapter 113 of the General Statutes shall apply to resident inspectors commissioned as special peace officers pursuant to this subsection.


(h) The Department shall determine the full cost of the employment and assignment of resident inspectors at each commercial hazardous waste facility located within the State.  Such costs shall include, but are not limited to, costs incurred for salaries, benefits, travel, training, equipment, supplies, telecommunication and data transmission, offices and other facilities other than those provided by the owner or operator, and administrative expenses.  The Department shall establish and revise as necessary a schedule of fees to be assessed on the users of each such facility to recover the actual cost of the resident inspector program at that facility.  The operator of each such facility shall serve as the collection agent for such fees, shall account to the Department on a monthly basis for all fees collected, and shall deposit with the Department all funds collected pursuant to this section within 15 days following the last day of the month in which such fees are collected.  Fees collected under this section shall be credited to the General Fund as nontax revenue.


(i) The Division shall establish and revise as necessary a program for assigning resident inspectors to commercial hazardous waste facilities so that scheduled rotation or equivalent oversight procedures ensure that each resident inspector will maintain objectivity.


(j) For purposes of this subsection, special purpose commercial hazardous waste facilities include:  a facility that manages limited quantities of hazardous waste;  a facility that limits its hazardous waste management activities to reclamation or recycling, including energy or materials recovery or a facility that stores hazardous waste primarily for use at such facilities;  or a facility that is determined to be low risk under rules adopted by the Commission pursuant to this subsection.  The Commission shall adopt rules to determine whether a commercial hazardous waste facility is a special purpose commercial hazardous waste facility and to establish classifications of special purpose commercial hazardous waste facilities.  The rules to determine whether a commercial hazardous waste facility is a special purpose commercial hazardous waste facility and to establish classifications of special purpose commercial hazardous waste facilities shall be based on factors including, but not limited to, the size of the facility, the type of treatment or storage being performed, the nature and volume of waste being treated or stored, the uniformity, similarity, or lack of diversity of the waste streams, the predictability of the nature of the waste streams and their treatability, whether the facility utilizes automated monitoring or safety devices that adequately perform functions that would otherwise be performed by a resident inspector, the fact that reclamation or recycling is being performed at the facility, and the compliance history of the facility and its operator.  Based on the foregoing factors and any increase or decrease in the number of sensitive land uses over time or in estimated population density over time reported pursuant to 
G.S. 130A-295.01(f)
, rules adopted pursuant to this subsection shall establish times and frequencies for the presence of a resident inspector on less than a full-time basis at special purpose commercial hazardous waste facilities and specify a minimum number of additional inspections at special purpose hazardous waste facilities.
Special purpose commercial hazardous waste facilities that utilize hazardous waste as a fuel source shall be inspected a minimum of 40 hours per week, unless compliance data for these facilities can be electronically monitored and recorded off-site by the Department.  The Department, considering the benefits provided by electronic monitoring, shall determine the number of hours of on-site inspection required at these facilities.  The Department shall maintain records of all inspections at special purpose commercial hazardous waste facilities.  Such records shall contain sufficient detail and shall be arranged in a readily understandable format so as to facilitate determination at any time as to whether the special purpose commercial hazardous waste facility is in compliance with the requirements of this subsection and of rules adopted pursuant to this subsection.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, special purpose commercial hazardous waste facilities shall be subject to inspection at all times during which the facility is in operation, undergoing any maintenance or repair, or undergoing any test or calibration.


(k) For purposes of this section, a facility that utilizes hazardous waste as a fuel or that has used hazardous waste as a fuel within the preceding calendar year, and that is an affiliate of and adjacent or contiguous to a commercial hazardous waste facility, shall be subject to inspection as a special purpose commercial hazardous waste facility under subsection (j) of this section as if the facility that utilizes hazardous waste as a fuel were a part of the commercial hazardous waste facility.


(l) As used in this section, the words “affiliate”, “parent”, and “subsidiary” have the same meaning as in 
17 Code of Federal Regulations § 240.12b-2
 (1 April 1990 Edition).

(27) The Department of Transportation is authorized to establish policies and promulgate rules providing for voluntary local government, property owner or highway user participation in the costs of maintenance or improvement of roads which would not otherwise be necessary or would not otherwise be performed by the Department of Transportation and which will result in a benefit to the property owner or highway user.  By way of illustration and not as a limitation, such costs include those incurred in connection with drainage improvements or maintenance, driveway connections, dust control on unpaved roads, surfacing or paving of roads and the acquisition of rights-of-way.  Local government, property owner and highway user participation can be in the form of materials, money, or land (for right-of-way) as deemed appropriate by the Department of Transportation.  The authority of this section shall not be used to authorize, construct or maintain toll roads or bridges.


(28) The Department of Transportation may obtain land, either by gift, lease or purchase which shall be used for the construction and maintenance of ridesharing parking lots.  The Department may design, construct, repair, and maintain ridesharing parking facilities.


(29) The Department of Transportation may establish policies and adopt rules about the size, location, direction of traffic flow, and the construction of driveway connections into any street or highway which is a part of the State Highway System.  The Department of Transportation may require the construction and public dedication of acceleration and deceleration lanes, and traffic storage lanes and medians by others for the driveway connections into any United States route, or North Carolina route, and on any secondary road route with an average daily traffic volume of 4,000 vehicles per day or more.


(29a) To coordinate with all public and private entities planning schools to provide written recommendations and evaluations of driveway access and traffic operational and safety impacts on the State highway system resulting from the development of the proposed sites.  All public and private entities shall, upon acquiring land for a new school or prior to beginning construction of a new school, relocating a school, or expanding an existing school, request from the Department a written evaluation and written recommendations to ensure that all proposed access points comply with the criteria in the current North Carolina Department of Transportation “Policy on Street and Driveway Access”.  The Department shall provide the written evaluation and recommendations within a reasonable time, which shall not exceed 60 days.  This subdivision applies to improvements that are not located on the school property.  The Department shall have the power to grant final approval of any project design under this subdivision.  To facilitate completion of the evaluation and recommendations within the required 60 days, in lieu of the evaluation by the Department, schools may engage an independent traffic engineer prequalified by the Department.  The resulting evaluation and recommendations from the independent traffic engineer shall also fulfill any similar requirements imposed by a unit of local government.  This subdivision shall not be construed to require the public or private entities planning schools to meet the recommendations made by the Department or the independent traffic engineer, except those highway improvements that are required for safe ingress and egress to the State highway system, pursuant to subdivision (29) of this section, and that are physically connected to a driveway on the school property.  The total cost of any improvements to the State highway system provided by a school pursuant to this subdivision, including those improvements pursuant to subdivision (29) of this section, shall be reimbursed by the Department.  Any agreement between a school and the Department to make improvements to the State highway system shall not include a requirement for acquisition of right-of-way by the school, unless the school is owned by an entity that has eminent domain power.  Nothing in this subdivision shall preclude the Department from entering into an agreement with the school whereby the school installs the agreed upon improvements and the Department provides full reimbursement for the associated costs incurred by the school, including design fees and any costs of right-of-way or easements.  The term “school,” as used in this subdivision, means any facility engaged in the educational instruction of children in any grade or combination of grades from kindergarten through the twelfth grade at which attendance satisfies the compulsory attendance law and includes charter schools authorized under 
G.S. 115C-218.5
.  The term “improvements,” as used in this subdivision, refers to all facilities within the right-of-way required to be installed to satisfy the road cross-section requirements depicted upon the approved plans.  These facilities shall include roadway construction, including pavement installation and medians;  ditches and shoulders;  storm drainage pipes, culverts, and related appurtenances;  and, where required, curb and gutter;  signals, including pedestrian safety signals;  street lights;  sidewalks;  and design fees.  Improvements shall not include any costs for public utilities.


(29b) The Department of Transportation shall consider exceptions to the sight distance requirement for driveway locations in instances where the curves of the road are close and frequent. Exceptions shall be granted in instances where sufficient sight distance can be provided or established through other means such as advisory speed signs, convex mirrors, and advanced warning signs. When appropriate, the Department shall consider lowering the speed limit on the relevant portion of the road. The Department may require a driveway permit applicant to cover the cost of installing the appropriate signage around the driveway, including speed limit reduction and driveway warning signs, and may also require the applicant to install and maintain convex or other mirrors to increase the safety around the driveway location.
This subdivision applies only to sections of roadway where the minimum sight distance as defined in the published “Policy on Street and Driveway Access to North Carolina Highways” is not available for a proposed driveway. 


(30) Consistent with 
G.S. 130A-309.14(a1)

(a) For the purpose of promoting health, safety, morals, or the general welfare of the community, any city may adopt zoning and development regulation ordinances.  These ordinances may be adopted as part of a unified development ordinance or as a separate ordinance.  A zoning ordinance may regulate and restrict the height, number of stories and size of buildings and other structures, the percentage of lots that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts and other open spaces, the density of population, the location and use of buildings, structures and land.  The ordinance shall provide density credits or severable development rights for dedicated rights-of-way pursuant to 
G.S. 136-66.10
 or 
G.S. 136-66.11

(c) The regulations may also provide that the board of adjustment, the planning board, or the city council may issue special use permits or conditional use permits in the classes of cases or situations and in accordance with the principles, conditions, safeguards, and procedures specified therein and may impose reasonable and appropriate conditions and safeguards upon these permits.  Conditions and safeguards imposed under this subsection shall not include requirements for which the city does not have authority under statute to regulate nor requirements for which the courts have held to be unenforceable if imposed directly by the city.  When deciding special use permits or conditional use permits, the city council or planning board shall follow quasi-judicial procedures.  Notice of hearings on special or conditional use permit applications shall be as provided in 
G.S. 160A-388(a2)

G.S. 160A-364
.  Absent an imminent threat to public health or safety, a development moratorium adopted pursuant to this section shall not apply to any project for which a valid building permit issued pursuant to 
G.S. 160A-417

, to development for which substantial expenditures have already been made in good faith reliance on a prior valid administrative or quasi-judicial permit or approval, or to preliminary or final subdivision plats that have been accepted for review by the city prior to the call for public hearing to adopt the moratorium.  Any preliminary subdivision plat accepted for review by the city prior to the call for public hearing, if subsequently approved, shall be allowed to proceed to final plat approval without being subject to the moratorium.
Any ordinance establishing a development moratorium must expressly include at the time of adoption each of the following:

(4) A clear statement of the actions, and the schedule for those actions, proposed to be taken by the city during the duration of the moratorium to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.

No moratorium may be subsequently renewed or extended for any additional period unless the city shall have taken all reasonable and feasible steps proposed to be taken by the city in its ordinance establishing the moratorium to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium and unless new facts and conditions warrant an extension.  Any ordinance renewing or extending a development moratorium must expressly include, at the time of adoption, the findings set forth in subdivisions (1) through (4) of this subsection, including what new facts or conditions warrant the extension.
Any person aggrieved by the imposition of a moratorium on development approvals required by law may apply to the appropriate division of the General Court of Justice for an order enjoining the enforcement of the moratorium, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue that order.  Actions brought pursuant to this section shall be set down for immediate hearing, and subsequent proceedings in those actions shall be accorded priority by the trial and appellate courts.  In any such action, the city shall have the burden of showing compliance with the procedural requirements of this subsection.

(1) to (4) Repealed by 
S.L. 1997-259, § 5, eff. July 14, 1997
.


(4a) A carrier may continue to enforce reasonable employer participation and contribution requirements on small employers applying for coverage;  however, participation and contribution requirements may vary among small employers only by the size of the small employer group and shall not differ because of the health benefit plan involved.  In applying minimum participation requirements to a small employer, a small employer carrier shall not consider employees or dependents who have qualifying existing coverage in determining whether an applicable participation level is met.   “Qualifying existing coverage” means benefits or coverage provided under:  (i) Medicare, Medicaid, and other government funded programs;  or (ii) an employer-based health insurance or health benefit arrangement, including a self-insured plan, that provides benefits similar to or in excess of benefits provided under the basic health care plan.


(4b) Late enrollees may only be excluded from coverage for the greater of 18 months or an 18-month preexisting-condition exclusion;  however, if both a period of exclusion from coverage and a preexisting-condition exclusion are applicable to a late enrollee, the combined period shall not exceed 18 months.  If a period of exclusion from coverage is applied, a late enrollee shall be enrolled at the end of that period in the health benefit plan held at the time by the small employer.


(5) No small employer carrier, insurer, subsidiary of an insurer, or controlled individual of an insurance holding company shall provide stop loss, catastrophic, or reinsurance coverage to small employers who employ fewer than 26 eligible employees that does not comply with the underwriting, rating, and other applicable standards in this Act.  An insurer shall not issue a stop loss health insurance policy to any person, firm, corporation, partnership, or association defined as a small employer that does any of the following:

a. Provides direct coverage of health expenses payable to an individual.


b. Has an annual attachment point for claims incurred per individual that is lower than twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) for plan years beginning in 2013.  For subsequent policy years, the amount shall be indexed using the Consumer Price Index for Medical Services for All Urban Consumers for the South Region and shall be rounded to the nearest whole thousand dollars.  The index factor shall be the index as of July of the year preceding the change divided by the index as of July 2012.


c. Has an annual aggregate attachment point lower than the greater of one of the following:

1. One hundred twenty percent (120%) of expected claims.


2. Twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) for plan years beginning in 2013.  For subsequent policy years, the amount shall be indexed using the Consumer Price Index for Medical Services for All Urban Consumers for the South Region and shall be rounded to the nearest whole thousand dollars.  The index factor shall be the index as of July of the year preceding the change divided by the index as of July 2012.
Nothing in this subsection prohibits an insurer from providing additional incentives to small employers with benefits promoting a medical home or benefits that provide health care screenings, are focused on outcomes and key performance indicators, or are reimbursed on an outcomes basis rather than a fee-for-service basis.




(6) If a small employer carrier offers coverage to a small employer, the small employer carrier shall offer coverage to all eligible employees of a small employer and their dependents.  A small employer carrier shall not offer coverage to only certain individuals in a small employer group except in the case of late enrollees as provided in 
G.S. 58-50-130(a)(4)
.


(7), (8) Repealed by

(4) Facilitate the improvement of state and local educational systems so that all of them will be able to meet adequate and desirable goals in a society which requires continuous qualitative and quantitative advances in educational opportunities, methods and facilities.


(5) It is the policy of this Compact to encourage and promote local and state initiative in the development, maintenance, improvement and administration of educational systems and institutions in a manner which will accord with the needs and advantages of diversity among localities and states.


(6) The party states recognize that each of them has an interest in the quality and quantity of education furnished in each of the other states, as well as in the excellence of its own educational systems and institutions, because of the highly mobile character of individuals within the nation, and because of the products and services contributing to the health, welfare and economic advancement of each state which are supplied in significant part by persons educated in other states.


(1) The education commission of the states, hereinafter called “the commission,” is hereby established.  The commission shall consist of seven members representing each party state.  One of such members shall be the governor;  two shall be members of the state legislature selected by its respective houses and serving in such manner as the legislature may determine;  and four shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the governor, unless the laws of the state otherwise provide.  If the laws of a state prevent legislators from serving on the commission, six members shall be appointed and serve at the pleasure of the governor, unless the laws of the state otherwise provide.  In addition to any other principles or requirements which a state may establish for the appointment and service of its members of the commission, the guiding principle for the composition of the membership on the commission from each party state shall be that the members representing such state shall, by virtue of their training, experience, knowledge or affiliations be in a position collectively to reflect broadly the interests of the state government, higher education, the state education system, local education, lay and professional, public and nonpublic educational leadership.  Of those appointees, one shall be the head of a state agency or institution, designated by the governor, having responsibility for one or more programs of public education.  In addition to the members of the commission representing the party states, there may be not to exceed 10 nonvoting commissioners selected by the steering committee for terms of one year.  Such commissioners shall represent leading national organizations of professional educators or persons concerned with educational administration.


(2) The members of the commission shall be entitled to one vote each on the commission.  No action of the commission shall be binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of votes on the commission are cast in favor thereof.  Action of the commission shall be only at a meeting at which a majority of the commissioners are present.  The commission shall meet at least once a year.  In its bylaws, and subject to such directions and limitations as may be contained therein, the commission may delegate the exercise of any of its powers to the steering committee or the executive director, except for the power to approve budgets or requests for appropriations, the power to make policy recommendations pursuant to Article IV and adoption of the annual report pursuant to Article III(10).


(3) The commission shall have a seal.


(4) The commission shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, who shall be a governor, a vice-chairman and a treasurer.  The commission shall provide for the appointment of an executive director.  Such executive director shall serve at the pleasure of the commission, and together with the treasurer and such other personnel as the commission may deem appropriate shall be bonded in such amount as the commission shall determine.  The executive director shall be secretary.


(5) Irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of any of the party states, the executive director subject to the approval of the steering committee shall appoint, remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the functions of the commission, and shall fix the duties and compensation of such personnel.  The commission in its bylaws shall provide for the personnel policies and programs of the commission.


(6) The commission may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any party jurisdiction, the United States, or any subdivision or agency of the aforementioned governments, or from any agency of two or more of the party jurisdictions or their subdivisions.


(7) The commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this Compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials and services, conditional or otherwise, from any state, the United States, or any other governmental agency, or from any person, firm, association, foundation, or corporation, and may receive, utilize and dispose of the same.  Any donation or grant accepted by the commission pursuant to this paragraph or services borrowed pursuant to paragraph (6) of this article shall be reported in the annual report of the commission.  Such report shall include the nature, amount and conditions, if any, of the donation, grant, or services borrowed, and the identity of the donor or lender.


(8) The commission may establish and maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transaction of its business.  The commission may acquire, hold, and convey real and personal property and any interest therein.


(9) The commission shall adopt bylaws for the conduct of its business and shall have the power to amend and rescind these bylaws.  The commission shall publish its bylaws in convenient form and shall file a copy thereof and a copy of any amendment thereto, with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.


(10) The commission annually shall make to the governor and legislature of each party state a report covering the activities of the commission for the preceding year.  The commission may make such additional reports as it may deem desirable.


(1) Collect, correlate, analyze and interpret information and data concerning educational needs and resources.


(2) Encourage and foster research in all aspects of education, but with special reference to the desirable scope of instruction, organization, administration, and instructional methods and standards employed or suitable for employment in public educational systems.


(3) Develop proposals for adequate financing of education as a whole and at each of its many levels.


(4) Conduct or participate in research of the types referred to in this article in any instance where the commission finds that such research is necessary for the advancement of the purposes and policies of this Compact, utilizing fully the resources of national associations, regional compact organizations for higher education, and other agencies and institutions, both public and private.


(5) Formulate suggested policies and plans for the improvement of public education as a whole, or for any segment thereof, and make recommendations with respect thereto available to the appropriate governmental units, agencies and public officials.


(6) Do such other things as may be necessary or incidental to the administration of any of its authority or functions pursuant to this Compact.


(1) If the laws of the United States specifically so provide, or if administrative provision is made therefor within the federal government, the United States may be represented on the commission by not to exceed 10 representatives.  Any such representative or representatives of the United States shall be appointed and serve in such manner as may be provided by or pursuant to federal law, and may be drawn from any one or more branches of the federal government, but no such representatives shall have a vote on the commission.


(2) The commission may provide information and make recommendations to any executive or legislative agency or officer of the federal government concerning the common educational policies of the states, and may advise with any such agencies or officers concerning any matter of mutual interest.


(1) To assist in the expeditious conduct of its business when the full commission is not meeting, the commission shall elect a steering committee of 32 members which, subject to the provisions of this Compact and consistent with the policies of the commission, shall be constituted and function as provided in the bylaws of the commission.  One fourth of the voting membership of the steering committee shall consist of governors, one fourth shall consist of legislators, and the remainder shall consist of other members of the commission.  A federal representative on the commission may serve with the steering committee, but without vote.  The voting members of the steering committee shall serve for terms of two years, except that members elected to the first steering committee of the commission shall be elected as follows:  16 for one year and 16 for two years.  The chairman, vice-chairman, and treasurer of the commission shall be members of the steering committee and, anything in this paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding, shall serve during their continuance in these offices.  Vacancies in the steering committee shall not affect its authority to act, but the commission at its next regularly ensuing meeting following the occurrence of any vacancy shall fill it for the unexpired term.  No person shall serve more than two terms as a member of the steering committee;  provided that service for a partial term of one year or less shall not be counted toward the two-term limitation.


(2) The commission may establish advisory and technical committees composed of state, local, and federal officials, and private persons to advise it with respect to any one or more of its functions.  Any advisory or technical committee may, on request of the states concerned, be established to consider any matter of special concern to two or more of the party states.


(3) The commission may establish such additional committees as its bylaws may provide.


(1) The commission shall advise the governor or designated officer or officers of each party state of its budget and estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state.  Each of the commission's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states.


(2) The total amount of appropriation requests under any budget shall be apportioned among the party states.  In making such apportionment, the commission shall devise and employ a formula which takes equitable account of the populations and per capita income levels of the party states.


(3) The commission shall not pledge the credit of any party states.  The commission may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it pursuant to Article III(7) of this Compact, provided that the commission takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to incurring an obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner.  Except where the commission makes use of funds available to it pursuant to Article III(7) thereof, the commission shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party states adequate to meet the same.


(4) The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements.  The receipts and disbursements of the commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established by its bylaws.  However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the commission shall be audited yearly by a qualified public accountant, and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual reports of the commission.


(5) The accounts of the commission shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly constituted officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the commission.


(6) Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent commission compliance with laws relating to audit or inspection of accounts by or on behalf of any government contributing to the support of the commission.


(1) This Compact shall have as eligible parties all states, territories, and possessions of the United States, the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.  In respect of any such jurisdiction not having a governor, the term “governor,” as used in this Compact, shall mean the closest equivalent official of such jurisdiction.


(2) Any state or other eligible jurisdiction may enter into this Compact and it shall become binding thereon when it has adopted the same:  Provided that in order to enter into initial effect, adoption by at least 10 eligible party jurisdictions shall be required.


(3) Adoption of the Compact may be either by enactment thereof or by adherence thereto by the governor;  provided that in the absence of enactment, adherence by the governor shall be sufficient to make his state a party only until December 31, 1967.  During any period when a state is participating in this Compact through gubernatorial action, the governor shall appoint those persons who, in addition to himself, shall serve as the members of the commission from his state, and shall provide to the commission an equitable share of the financial support of the commission from any source available to him.


(4) Except for a withdrawal effective on December 31, 1967, in accordance with paragraph (3) of this article, any party state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states.  No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.

(4) A clear statement of the actions, and the schedule for those actions, proposed to be taken by the county during the duration of the moratorium to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium.

No moratorium may be subsequently renewed or extended for any additional period unless the city shall have taken all reasonable and feasible steps proposed to be taken by the county in its ordinance establishing the moratorium to address the problems or conditions leading to imposition of the moratorium and unless new facts and conditions warrant an extension.  Any ordinance renewing or extending a development moratorium must expressly include, at the time of adoption, the findings set forth in subdivisions (1) through (4) of this subsection, including what new facts or conditions warrant the extension.
Any person aggrieved by the imposition of a moratorium on development approvals required by law may apply to the appropriate division of the General Court of Justice for an order enjoining the enforcement of the moratorium, and the court shall have jurisdiction to issue that order.  Actions brought pursuant to this section shall be set down for immediate hearing, and subsequent proceedings in those actions shall be accorded priority by the trial and appellate courts.  In any such action, the county shall have the burden of showing compliance with the procedural requirements of this subsection.

(o) Basinwide Hydrologic Models. -- The Department shall develop a basinwide hydrologic model for each of the 17 major river basins in the State as provided in this subsection.

(1) Definitions. -- As used in this subsection:

a. “Ecological flow” means the stream flow necessary to protect ecological integrity.


b. “Ecological integrity” means the ability of an aquatic system to support and maintain a balanced, integrated, adaptive community of organisms having a species composition, diversity, and functional organization comparable to prevailing ecological conditions and, when subject to disruption, to recover and continue to provide the natural goods and services that normally accrue from the system.


c. “Groundwater resource” means any water flowing or lying under the surface of the earth or contained within an aquifer.


d. “Prevailing ecological conditions” means the ecological conditions determined by reference to the applicable period of record of the United States Geological Survey stream gauge data, including data reflecting the ecological conditions that exist after the construction and operation of existing flow modification devices, such as dams, but excluding data collected when stream flow is temporarily affected by in-stream construction activity.


e. “Surface water resource” means any lake, pond, river, stream, creek, run, spring, or other water flowing or lying on the surface of the earth.



(2) Schedule. -- The Department shall develop a schedule for basinwide hydrologic model development.  In developing the schedule, the Department shall give priority to developing hydrologic models for river basins or portions of river basins that are experiencing or are likely to experience water supply shortages, where the ecological integrity is threatened or likely to become threatened, or for which an existing hydrologic model has not been developed by the Department or other persons or entities.


(3) Model. -- Each basinwide hydrologic model shall:

a. Include surface water resources within the river basin, groundwater resources within the river basin to the extent known by the Department, transfers into and out of the river basin that are required to be registered under 
G.S. 143-215.22H
, other withdrawals, ecological flow, instream flow requirements, projections of future withdrawals, an estimate of return flows within the river basin, inflow data, local water supply plans, and other scientific and technical information the Department deems relevant. 


b. Be designed to simulate the flows of each surface water resource within the basin that is identified as a source of water for a withdrawal registered under 
G.S. 143-215.22H
 in response to different variables, conditions, and scenarios.  The model shall specifically be designed to predict the places, times, frequencies, and intervals at which any of the following may occur:

1. Yield may be inadequate to meet all needs.


2. Yield may be inadequate to meet all essential water uses.


3. Ecological flow may be adversely affected.



c. Be based solely on data that is of public record and open to public review and comment.



(4) Ecological flow. -- The Department shall characterize the ecology in the different river basins and identify the flow necessary to maintain ecological integrity.  The Department shall create a Science Advisory Board to assist the Department in characterizing the natural ecology and identifying the flow requirements.  The Science Advisory Board shall include representatives from the Divisions of Water Resources and Water Quality of the Department, the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, the North Carolina Marine Fisheries Commission, and the Natural Heritage Program.  The Department shall also invite participation by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service;  the National Marine Fisheries Service;  representatives of organizations representing agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, electric public utilities, and local governments, with expertise in aquatic ecology and habitat;  and other individuals or organizations with expertise in aquatic ecology and habitat.  The Department shall ask the Science Advisory Board to review any report or study submitted to the Department for consideration that is relevant to characterizing the ecology of the different river basins and identifying flow requirements for maintenance of ecological integrity.  The Department shall consider such other information, including site specific analyses, that either the Board or the Department considers relevant to determining ecological flow requirements.


(5) Interstate cooperation. -- To the extent practicable, the Department shall work with neighboring states to develop basinwide hydrologic models for each river basin shared by North Carolina and another state.


(6) Approval and modification of hydrologic models. --

a. Upon completion of a hydrologic model, the Department shall:

4 U.S.C. § 112 (1965)
, has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.

In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective, and such obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.

Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the Compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.


(b) Technical Assistance, Fines, Suspension, Termination, and Default. -- If the Interstate Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this Compact, or the bylaws or duly promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:

(2) Alternative Dispute Resolution;


(3) Fines, fees, and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission;  and

The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this Compact, the bylaws, or duly promulgated rules, and any other grounds designated in Commission bylaws and rules.  The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission and of the default pending a cure of the default.  The Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default.  If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the Compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this Compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.
Within 60 days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the Commission shall notify the Governor, the Chief Justice or Chief Judicial Officer, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council of the termination.
The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.
The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.

(1) Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;


(2) Alternative Dispute Resolution;


(3) Fines, fees, and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission;  and


(4) Suspension or termination of membership in the Compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted, and the Interstate Commission has therefore determined that the offending state is in default.  Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the Chief Justice, or the Chief Judicial Officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council.


(c) Judicial Enforcement. -- The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the Compact and its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorneys' fees.


(d) Dissolution of Compact. -- The Compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state, which reduces membership in the Compact to one compacting state.

(b) The provisions of this Compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.


(a) Other Laws. -- Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this Compact.
All compacting states' laws, other than state Constitutions and other interstate compacts, conflicting with this Compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.


(b) Binding Effect of the Compact. -- All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the compacting states.
All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.
Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning or interpretation.
In the event any provision of this Compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective, and such obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this Compact becomes effective.”

G.S. 143-139
, 
153A-123

160A-175
 based upon the same violation.  Appeals from the assessment or imposition of such civil remedies shall be as provided in 
G.S. 160A-434
.
A local government may not adopt any ordinance in conflict with the exemption provided by subsection (c1) of this section.  No local ordinance or regulation shall be construed to limit the exemption provided by subsection (c1) of this section.
