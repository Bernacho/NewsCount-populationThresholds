(1) After the taking of a United States   1 census showing the population of any school district to be such as to entitle it to be changed from one class of school district to another;


(2) When a district, which at a decennial census, had sufficient population to entitle it to an advance to another class of district, has since suffered a large decrease in population, or which at a decennial census did not have sufficient population to entitle it to an advance to another class of district and has since increased in population, a census of the district may be authorized by the board of school directors of the district, and, if it shall appear that said district has not the required population to remain in the class in which the same then is or if it shall appear that the district has sufficient population to entitle it to advance to another class of district, the Superintendent of Public Instruction,  2 on the request of the board of school directors and upon receipt of the facts disclosed by said census, may issue his proclamation declaring such district to be of the class to which it properly belongs, as disclosed by the census of the school board.

(a) The classification of counties shall be ascertained and fixed according to their population by reference from time to time to the decennial United States census as hereinafter provided, deducting therefrom the number of persons residing on any lands that have been ceded to the United States.


(b) Whenever it shall appear by any such census that any county has attained a population entitling it to an advance in classification, or whenever it shall appear by the last two preceding censuses that a county has heretofore or hereafter decreased in population so as to recede in classification, as herein prescribed, it shall be the duty of the Governor, under the great seal of this Commonwealth, to certify that fact accordingly, to the board of county commissioners on or before the first day of October of the year succeeding that in which the census was taken or as soon thereafter as may be, which certificate shall be forwarded by the commissioners to the recorder of deeds and be recorded in his office.
It is the intent of this section that the classification of any county shall not be changed because its population has decreased at the time of one United States decennial census, because it is recognized that a change in the form of local government is attended by certain expense and hardship, and such change should not be occasioned by a temporary fluctuation in population, but rather only after it is demonstrated by two censuses that the population of a county has remained below the minimum figure of its class for at least a decade.


(c) Changes of class ascertained and certified as aforesaid shall become effective on the first day of January next following the year in which the change was so certified by the Governor to the county commissioners but the salaries of county officers shall not thereby be increased or decreased during the term for which they shall have been elected.  In the municipal election following such certification of change of class and preceding the effective date of such change, the proper number of persons shall be elected to fill any elective office which will exist in the county by the change of classification certified.  No election shall be held for any office which will be abolished as a result of such change of classification.

to

$4,375




35,000


or

$5,000



Salaries are payable monthly or quarterly for the duties imposed by this act.  The population is determined by the latest official census figures, except that no township shall be required to reduce the salary of a supervisor as a result of a decrease in population.  The compensation of supervisors, when employed as roadmasters, laborers, secretary, treasurer, assistant secretary, assistant treasurer or in any employe capacity not otherwise prohibited by this or any other act, shall be determined by the board of auditors, at an hourly, daily, weekly, semi-monthly or monthly basis, which shall be comparable to compensation paid in the locality for similar services.  The board of supervisors may establish a mileage allowance, under the act of July 20, 1979 (P.L. 156, No. 51), referred to as the Uniform Mileage Fee Law,  1 to be paid to officers and employes for the use of a personal vehicle when required and actually used for authorized township business.  No supervisor may receive compensation as an employe for attending a meeting of the board of supervisors.  Supervisors may continue to be compensated under prior law until such time as an ordinance is enacted under this act.  Any change in salary, compensation or emoluments of the elected office becomes effective at the beginning of the next term of the supervisor.  A decision by the township to pay, in whole or in part, to include supervisors not employed by the township in insurance plans, as authorized in subsection (c), shall not be implemented with regard to any nonemployee supervisor until the beginning of the next term of that supervisor.


(b) Any benefit provided to or for the benefit of a supervisor employed by the township in any employe capacity under this act in the form of inclusion in a pension plan paid for in whole or in part by the township is compensation within the meaning of this act to the extent that benefit is paid for by the township and is determined by the board of auditors;  however:

(1) Supervisors are eligible for inclusion in township pension plans only if they are employed by the township in any employe capacity under this act.  In order to be eligible for inclusion in the plans, supervisor-employes must meet the same requirements as other employes of the township who are eligible to participate in a pension plan.  Pension plans shall not improperly discriminate in favor of a supervisor-employe.


(2) Once given, auditor approval for inclusion of supervisor-employes shall not be rescinded in any subsequent years as long as the pension plan remains in effect and the supervisors remain employed by the township and continue to meet the same requirements as other employes of the township who are eligible to participate in a pension plan;  nor shall the auditors act in any way that disqualifies the pension plan under Federal law.


(3) No change in the nature or rate of the contributions of a defined contribution plan and no change in the benefit formula of a defined benefit plan shall be initiated by the board of supervisors with respect to a supervisor-employe without auditor approval.


(4) A pension or annuity contract made by a township between January 1, 1959, and March 31, 1985, that includes or provides for benefits for supervisor-employes or retired supervisor-employes at township expense is not void or unlawful solely because the inclusion of supervisor-employes or retired supervisor-employes was not previously approved by the township auditors.  No penalty, assessment, surcharge, forfeiture or disciplinary action of any kind may occur as a result of that participation by supervisor-employes.


(5) All premium, contribution or similar payments made by a township on pension or annuity contracts on behalf of supervisor-employes between January 1, 1959, and March 31, 1985, which would have been proper but for the absence of auditor approval are hereby approved.  Any benefits payable to any supervisor-employe or his beneficiaries on account of any premium, contribution or similar payments made by a township during that period shall continue.  Any premium, contribution or similar payments made by a township after March 31, 1985, requires auditor approval under this subsection.


(6) If a supervisor-employe personally contributed toward a township-sponsored pension plan or annuity that is not approved by the township auditors or not approved by this act, he shall receive a refund of his total contributions thereto plus any interest accumulated thereon.  In lieu of a refund of contributions plus accumulated interest, a supervisor-employe who personally contributed toward a pension or annuity plan in which he participated may elect to purchase that portion of his pension or annuity funded by the township.  A qualified actuary, who shall report his determination under the act of December 18, 1984 (P.L. 1005, No. 205), known as the “Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act,”   2 shall determine the amount the supervisor-employe shall pay to purchase the township-funded portion of the annuity or pension.


(7) Supervisors who are not employes of the township are not eligible for participation in any pension or annuity contract paid in whole or in part by the township.  No supervisor who was not an employe of the township but was included in a township-paid pension or annuity plan made by a township between January 1, 1959, and March 31, 1985, is subject to any penalty, assessment, surcharge, forfeiture or disciplinary action.  Any residual interest, value, refund of premium or benefits payable on or after March 31, 1985, arising out of the township-paid interest of a supervisor who was not an employe is the exclusive property of the township.



(1) Supervisors are eligible for inclusion in township pension plans only if they are employed by the township in any employe capacity under this act.  In order to be eligible for inclusion in the plans, supervisor-employes must meet the same requirements as other employes of the township who are eligible to participate in a pension plan.  Pension plans shall not improperly discriminate in favor of a supervisor-employe.


(2) Once given, auditor approval for inclusion of supervisor-employes shall not be rescinded in any subsequent years as long as the pension plan remains in effect and the supervisors remain employed by the township and continue to meet the same requirements as other employes of the township who are eligible to participate in a pension plan;  nor shall the auditors act in any way that disqualifies the pension plan under Federal law.


(3) No change in the nature or rate of the contributions of a defined contribution plan and no change in the benefit formula of a defined benefit plan shall be initiated by the board of supervisors with respect to a supervisor-employe without auditor approval.


(4) A pension or annuity contract made by a township between January 1, 1959, and March 31, 1985, that includes or provides for benefits for supervisor-employes or retired supervisor-employes at township expense is not void or unlawful solely because the inclusion of supervisor-employes or retired supervisor-employes was not previously approved by the township auditors.  No penalty, assessment, surcharge, forfeiture or disciplinary action of any kind may occur as a result of that participation by supervisor-employes.


(5) All premium, contribution or similar payments made by a township on pension or annuity contracts on behalf of supervisor-employes between January 1, 1959, and March 31, 1985, which would have been proper but for the absence of auditor approval are hereby approved.  Any benefits payable to any supervisor-employe or his beneficiaries on account of any premium, contribution or similar payments made by a township during that period shall continue.  Any premium, contribution or similar payments made by a township after March 31, 1985, requires auditor approval under this subsection.


(6) If a supervisor-employe personally contributed toward a township-sponsored pension plan or annuity that is not approved by the township auditors or not approved by this act, he shall receive a refund of his total contributions thereto plus any interest accumulated thereon.  In lieu of a refund of contributions plus accumulated interest, a supervisor-employe who personally contributed toward a pension or annuity plan in which he participated may elect to purchase that portion of his pension or annuity funded by the township.  A qualified actuary, who shall report his determination under the act of December 18, 1984 (P.L. 1005, No. 205), known as the “Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and Recovery Act,”   2 shall determine the amount the supervisor-employe shall pay to purchase the township-funded portion of the annuity or pension.


(7) Supervisors who are not employes of the township are not eligible for participation in any pension or annuity contract paid in whole or in part by the township.  No supervisor who was not an employe of the township but was included in a township-paid pension or annuity plan made by a township between January 1, 1959, and March 31, 1985, is subject to any penalty, assessment, surcharge, forfeiture or disciplinary action.  Any residual interest, value, refund of premium or benefits payable on or after March 31, 1985, arising out of the township-paid interest of a supervisor who was not an employe is the exclusive property of the township.


(c) In addition to the compensation authorized under this section, supervisors while in office or while in the employ of the township may be eligible for inclusion in township-paid insurance plans, as follows:

(1) Supervisors, whether or not they are employed by the township, and their dependents are eligible for inclusion in group life, health, hospitalization, medical service and accident insurance plans paid in whole or in part by the township.  Supervisors and their dependents who are over sixty-five years of age are eligible for inclusion in supplemental Medicare insurance coverage paid, in whole or in part, by the township.  Their inclusion in those plans does not require auditor approval, but does require submission of a letter requesting participation at a regularly scheduled meeting of the board of supervisors before commencing participation.  The insurance shall be uniformly applicable to those covered and shall not give eligibility preference to or improperly discriminate in favor of supervisors.  No policy of group life insurance shall contain any provision for a cash surrender value, loan value or any other benefit beyond the face amount of insurance.  The policy may contain a provision that when the insurance ceases because of termination of employment or term of office, the person is entitled to have issued to him by the insurer, without evidence of insurability, an individual policy of insurance on any form customarily issued by the insurer at the age and for the amount applied for if the amount is not in excess of the amount of life insurance which ceases because of the termination and the application for the individual policy is made and first premium is paid to the insurer within thirty-one days after termination.


(2) Any life, health, hospitalization, medical service or accident insurance coverage contract made by a township between January 1, 1959, and March 31, 1985, that includes or provides coverage for supervisors not employed by the township is not void or unlawful because inclusion of those supervisors was subsequently found to be without lawful authority.  No penalty, assessment, surcharge, forfeiture or disciplinary action may occur as a result of participation by those supervisors.  Insurance benefits paid or payable to insureds or their beneficiaries arising out of or on account of deaths, injuries, accidents or illnesses occurring before March 30, 1988, are the property of the insureds or their beneficiaries.


(3) All payments made by a township on any group life, health, hospitalization, medical service or accident insurance coverage contracts on behalf of supervisors who were not employes between January 1, 1959, and March 31, 1985, which would have been proper but for the absence of auditor approval are hereby approved.  Any benefits payable to any supervisor or his beneficiaries on account of those payments during that time shall continue.


(4) The township may deduct from any compensation payable to a supervisor such part of any insurance premium or charge which is payable by the supervisor within the terms of the particular township's insurance plan.


(5) The township may pay the cost, in whole or in part, of supplemental Medicare insurance coverage for supervisors and employes who are over sixty-five years of age.



(1) Supervisors, whether or not they are employed by the township, and their dependents are eligible for inclusion in group life, health, hospitalization, medical service and accident insurance plans paid in whole or in part by the township.  Supervisors and their dependents who are over sixty-five years of age are eligible for inclusion in supplemental Medicare insurance coverage paid, in whole or in part, by the township.  Their inclusion in those plans does not require auditor approval, but does require submission of a letter requesting participation at a regularly scheduled meeting of the board of supervisors before commencing participation.  The insurance shall be uniformly applicable to those covered and shall not give eligibility preference to or improperly discriminate in favor of supervisors.  No policy of group life insurance shall contain any provision for a cash surrender value, loan value or any other benefit beyond the face amount of insurance.  The policy may contain a provision that when the insurance ceases because of termination of employment or term of office, the person is entitled to have issued to him by the insurer, without evidence of insurability, an individual policy of insurance on any form customarily issued by the insurer at the age and for the amount applied for if the amount is not in excess of the amount of life insurance which ceases because of the termination and the application for the individual policy is made and first premium is paid to the insurer within thirty-one days after termination.


(2) Any life, health, hospitalization, medical service or accident insurance coverage contract made by a township between January 1, 1959, and March 31, 1985, that includes or provides coverage for supervisors not employed by the township is not void or unlawful because inclusion of those supervisors was subsequently found to be without lawful authority.  No penalty, assessment, surcharge, forfeiture or disciplinary action may occur as a result of participation by those supervisors.  Insurance benefits paid or payable to insureds or their beneficiaries arising out of or on account of deaths, injuries, accidents or illnesses occurring before March 30, 1988, are the property of the insureds or their beneficiaries.


(3) All payments made by a township on any group life, health, hospitalization, medical service or accident insurance coverage contracts on behalf of supervisors who were not employes between January 1, 1959, and March 31, 1985, which would have been proper but for the absence of auditor approval are hereby approved.  Any benefits payable to any supervisor or his beneficiaries on account of those payments during that time shall continue.


(4) The township may deduct from any compensation payable to a supervisor such part of any insurance premium or charge which is payable by the supervisor within the terms of the particular township's insurance plan.


(5) The township may pay the cost, in whole or in part, of supplemental Medicare insurance coverage for supervisors and employes who are over sixty-five years of age.

(a)(1) If a majority of the qualified electors voting on the question shall vote in the affirmative, the county election board of the said county shall purchase for each election district of such county, city, borough or township, one or more voting machines, of a kind or kinds approved by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, as hereinafter provided, and of sufficient capacity to accommodate the names of a reasonable number of candidates for all public and party offices which, under the provisions of existing laws and party rules, are likely to be voted for at any future election, and shall notify the Secretary of the Commonwealth, in writing, that they have done so.  The county election board shall provide machines in good working order, and shall preserve and keep them in repair.  Voting machines of different kinds may be used for different election districts in the same county, city, borough or township.  In each election district in which voting machines are used, the county election board shall provide an adequate number of voting machines for the electors of the election district in accordance with section 530.  1


(2) Whenever there shall be a number of candidates in a primary election so great as to require voting machines limited to the candidates of one political party, there shall be two voting machines of the same kind in any district for any party which has more than three hundred and fifty (350) registered qualified electors in that district.



(a)(1) If a majority of the qualified electors voting on the question shall vote in the affirmative, the county election board of the said county shall purchase for each election district of such county, city, borough or township, one or more voting machines, of a kind or kinds approved by the Secretary of the Commonwealth, as hereinafter provided, and of sufficient capacity to accommodate the names of a reasonable number of candidates for all public and party offices which, under the provisions of existing laws and party rules, are likely to be voted for at any future election, and shall notify the Secretary of the Commonwealth, in writing, that they have done so.  The county election board shall provide machines in good working order, and shall preserve and keep them in repair.  Voting machines of different kinds may be used for different election districts in the same county, city, borough or township.  In each election district in which voting machines are used, the county election board shall provide an adequate number of voting machines for the electors of the election district in accordance with section 530.  1


(2) Whenever there shall be a number of candidates in a primary election so great as to require voting machines limited to the candidates of one political party, there shall be two voting machines of the same kind in any district for any party which has more than three hundred and fifty (350) registered qualified electors in that district.


(b) Such voting machines shall be installed, either simultaneously or gradually, in political subdivisions which adopt them.  Upon the installation of voting machines in any election district, the use of paper ballots therein shall be discontinued, except as otherwise provided herein.


(c) If voting machines are installed gradually, they may be introduced, in the case of counties, in alphabetical order--by cities, boroughs and townships, so that they will first be used in the city, borough or township, the name of which is first in alphabetical order, and then in the city, borough or township, the name of which is next in alphabetical order, and so on.  In cities, boroughs and townships, they shall be introduced in numerical or alphabetical order by wards and election districts, if any, so that they will first be used in the first election district of the first ward, and then in the second election district of the first ward, and so on.  After they have been installed in all the election districts in the first ward, they may be installed, in the same manner, in the second ward, then in the third ward, and so on.  In any event, the machines shall be installed as rapidly as practicable after the electors have voted in favor of them.
If voting machines are installed gradually they may also be introduced in the case of counties by legislative districts with priority in installation being given to municipalities therein in the order of their descending population rank according to the last official decennial census.  Within such municipality the voting machines shall be introduced in numerical order by wards and election districts, if any, so that they will first be used in the first election district of the first ward and then in the second election district of the first ward and so on.  After they have been installed in all the election districts in the first ward, they shall be installed in the same manner in the second ward, then in the third ward, and so on.


(d) If the question hereinbefore provided shall have been submitted to the qualified electors of the county, city, borough or township, and the majority of the electors voting thereon shall have voted favorably thereon, and if the county election board shall not, within one year, have executed their contract or contracts providing for the purchase or procurement of voting machines for use at the next general, municipal or primary election, occurring at least one year and sixty days after the referendum, then the Secretary of the Commonwealth shall forthwith, in writing, notify the said county election board that, after the expiration of thirty days, he, under the authority of this act, on behalf of the said county, will award, make, and execute such contract or contracts, unless the said county election board meanwhile shall have made and executed the same.


(e) If, upon the expiration of said thirty days, the county election board still shall not have made and executed the contract or contracts providing for the delivery of machines as aforesaid, the Secretary of the Commonwealth, on behalf of the said county and upon the approval of the Attorney General as to form, shall thereupon award, make, and execute a contract or contracts for the purchase or procurement of a sufficient number of voting machines, approved as required by this act, for each election district within each such county, city, borough or township;  and the cost of such voting machines, including the delivery thereof, and of making and entering into the said contract or contracts, including the preparation and printing of specifications and all other necessary expense incidental thereto, shall be the debt of the said county, and, upon the certificate of the Secretary of the Commonwealth, it shall be the duty of the controller, if any, to allow, and of the treasurer of the county to pay, the sum out of any appropriation available therefor, or out of the first unappropriated moneys that come into the treasury of the county.


(f) Provided, however, That if the county election board or the Secretary of the Commonwealth, as the case may be, shall find it impracticable to procure a voting machine or voting machines for each election district of the county, city, borough or township, for use at the general, municipal or primary election then next ensuing, they or he shall provide as many machines as it shall be practicable to procure, and, as soon thereafter as practicable, shall provide the remainder of such machines required hereunder.  The machines shall be installed in the election district or districts, in the manner provided for the gradual introduction of voting machines in paragraph (c) of this section.


(g) Any county, city, borough or township may, by a majority vote of its qualified electors cast at any general election held not earlier than one hundred and three weeks after they have voted to adopt such machines, direct the discontinuance of the use of voting machines at elections held in such county, city, borough or township.  The question for the discontinuance of the use of such voting machines shall be submitted to the voters, subject to the same requirements as to resolution or petition and signatures thereon, as is required for the submission of the question on the authorization of the use of such voting machines.  Such question for discontinuance must be submitted to the qualified electors of the county or municipality which voted on the question of the adoption of voting machines, and the question of discontinuance shall not be submitted to the qualified electors of any city, borough or township forming a part only of any county which has previously voted to adopt voting machines for the entire county, unless the qualified electors of such city, borough or township have previously, by separate vote of its qualified electors, voted in favor of the adoption of voting machines.  Where the qualified electors of any city, borough or township and the qualified electors of the entire county containing therein such city, borough or township, both have voted by separate questions in favor of the adoption of voting machines, a subsequent vote by the qualified electors of the entire county in favor of discontinuance shall not be considered as a vote to discontinue the use of voting machines in such city, borough or township.
Such question as to the discontinuance of the use of voting machines shall be submitted in the following form:
“Shall the use of voting machines be continued in the (city, borough or township), of ․․․․․․․․․․․․?”


(h) If it shall appear at any election that the county board requires additional voting machines for the use of the electors, said county board shall have authority to enter into a contract or contracts for the rental of a sufficient number of machines for said election.

In the case of a municipality, the adjusted annual grant shall equal either (1) fifty percent (50%) of the total of the remaining expenditures, or (2) the product obtained by multiplying the population of the area within the jurisdiction of the department or board of health of the municipality times the number of months during which it was not subject to the jurisdiction of a county department of health times forty-three and three-fourths cents (43  3/4 ¢) in fiscal year 1990-1991, and fifty cents (50¢) in fiscal year 1991-1992 and each fiscal year thereafter, whichever figure is the lower.  In applying the formula set out in clause (2) of this paragraph, any month which fell in a quarter for which no installment of the annual grant was paid to the municipality shall not be counted.  For the purpose of computation any fraction of a month shall be counted as one month.
If the adjusted initial or annual grant exceeds the initial or annual grant actually received by a county department of health or a municipality, the State Secretary of Health shall, within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the statement of expenditures, draw a requisition upon the State Auditor General in favor of such county department of health or municipality for the amount by which the adjusted initial or annual grant exceeds the initial or annual grant actually received.
If the adjusted initial or annual grant is less than the initial or annual grant actually received by a county department of health or a municipality, the State Secretary of Health shall charge the amount by which the initial or annual grant actually received exceeds the adjusted initial or annual grant against one or more installments of the next annual grant.  If any subsequent installment of the annual grant is not paid to the particular county department of health or municipality because of the failure of the county department of health or municipality to comply with the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, or because the municipality has decided to become subject to the jurisdiction of a county department of health in accordance with section 15 of this act, the State Secretary of Health may require a refund of such amount to the State.


(d) Environmental Health Services.  The Commonwealth shall pay an additional annual grant of not more than one dollar and fifty cents ($1.50) per capita resident to each county department of health or department or board of health of a municipality eligible for grants under this act for environmental health services provided by the county or municipality.

(a) Acknowledgment.--The General Assembly acknowledges the lack of coordination of services for the handicapped in this Commonwealth and supports the concept of a State Commission for the Handicapped to coordinate service delivery and to increase access to services for all handicapped citizens.  The development of such a concept currently is under legislative study.

(1) Public services to deaf persons, such as medical services, mental health services, social services, welfare services, employment services, legal services, etc., are often inaccessible, fragmented and of poor quality due to communication barriers.


(2) These problems can be addressed by providing a special focus on services for the deaf and hard of hearing by implementing and coordinating communication assistance, training, information and referral services for those with hearing handicaps and for those who provide services to the hard of hearing.


(3) It has been estimated that approximately 82,000 deaf and 244,000 hard of hearing persons reside in Pennsylvania.  Since 1971, 22 states have legislatively established a commission, office, council or board for the deaf and hard of hearing.

(b) It is hereby declared to be the public policy of this Commonwealth to foster the employment of all individuals in accordance with their fullest capacities regardless of their race, color, religious creed, ancestry, age, sex, national origin, handicap or disability, use of guide or support animals because of the blindness, deafness or physical handicap of the user or because the user is a handler or trainer of support or guide animals, and to safeguard their right to obtain and hold employment without such discrimination, to assure equal opportunities to all individuals and to safeguard their rights to public accommodation and to secure housing accommodation and commercial property regardless of race, color, familial status, religious creed, ancestry, age, sex, national origin, handicap or disability, use of guide or support animals because of blindness or deafness of the user or because the user is a handler or trainer of guide or support animals.


(c) This act shall be deemed an exercise of the police power of the Commonwealth for the protection of the public welfare, prosperity, health and peace of the people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

(a) General rule.--No child shall initially be committed to an institution for a period longer than four years or a period longer than he could have been sentenced by the court if he had been convicted of the same offense as an adult, whichever is less.  The initial commitment may be extended for a similar period of time, or modified, if the court finds after hearing that the extension or modification will effectuate the original purpose for which the order was entered.  The child shall have notice of the extension or modification hearing and shall be given an opportunity to be heard.  The committing court shall review each commitment every six months and shall hold a disposition review hearing at least every nine months.


(b) Transfer to other institution.--After placement of the child, and if his progress with the institution warrants it, the institution may seek to transfer the child to a less secure facility, including a group home or foster boarding home.  The institution shall give the committing court written notice of all requests for transfer and shall give the attorney for the Commonwealth written notice of a request for transfer from a secure facility to another facility.  If the court, or in the case of a request to transfer from a secure facility, the attorney for the Commonwealth, does not object to the request for transfer within ten days after the receipt of such notice, the transfer may be effectuated.  If the court, or in the case of a request to transfer from a secure facility, the attorney for the Commonwealth, objects to the transfer, the court shall hold a hearing within 20 days after objecting to the transfer for the purpose of reviewing the commitment order.  The institution shall be notified of the scheduled hearing, at which hearing evidence may be presented by any interested party on the issue of the propriety of the transfer.  If the institution seeks to transfer to a more secure facility the child shall have a full hearing before the committing court.  At the hearing, the court may reaffirm or modify its commitment order.


(c) Notice of available facilities and services.--Immediately after the Commonwealth adopts its budget, the Department of Public Welfare shall notify the courts and the General Assembly, for each Department of Public Welfare region, of the available:

(1) Secure beds for the serious juvenile offenders.


(2) General residential beds for the adjudicated delinquent child.

Pennsylvania Statutes Title 3 P.S. Agriculture § 2502. Findings and declarations,https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-3-ps-agriculture/pa-st-sect-3-2502.html,"
(1) An alarming percentage of our school-aged children have an unhealthy weight.  In large part, this is due to poor eating habits.  Pilot programs have shown that focused nutritional education in the early school years coupled with exposure to a variety of healthy foods can initiate a long-term increase in healthy eating habits as children mature.


(2) Agriculture is this Commonwealth's most successful economic engine.  Unfortunately, the percentage of our population directly involved in agriculture has decreased dramatically over the last several decades.  Knowledge about the sources of our food and agriculture in Pennsylvania is not widespread in our communities, particularly in less affluent areas.  Educational programs for young children providing hands-on experience with agriculture increases an awareness of what constitutes a healthy diet.  Thus, it is vital to inform the future citizens of this Commonwealth about good eating habits, while demonstrating the importance of the role of local farms in achieving this crucial goal.


(3) An initiative accomplishing this twofold purpose is decisive in ensuring the citizenry of this Commonwealth will be healthy in the coming years.  The purposes of this program are to educate kindergartners and their families about the importance of choosing healthy, locally produced foods and increase awareness of Pennsylvania agriculture.  Furthermore, the initiative should aid Pennsylvania farmers in gaining access to new markets within this Commonwealth.  Consequently, the Commonwealth should institute a program including:

(i) Nutrition education involving student participation which is integrated into regular subjects in the curriculum of primary and secondary education institutions.


(ii) Focusing on locally grown foods provided from Pennsylvania farms.


(iii) Equipping teachers and other educators to incorporate nutrition and agriculture education into their instruction.


(iv) Providing for new direct marketing opportunities for Pennsylvania farmers.


(v) Providing for family and community involvement, including parent, caregiver and community group participation in education activities.


(vi) Visits to nearby farms for school children so they may understand and learn more about the sources of their food.

(1) Since fish at large in the waters of this Commonwealth are a natural resource, protection and conservation of this resource in the public interest is the obligation of the Commonwealth.


(2) The shad which inhabit the waters of the Delaware River system constitute a potentially valuable source of food and raw materials and, under proper management, are capable of producing a constant and abundant harvest without depletion of the species and consequent shortages of supply.  The important shad fishery of the Delaware River has been depleted so that the actual harvest is far below the potential yield of this resource which at one time yielded as much as 16,000,000 fish yearly but in recent years has yielded only a few hundred thousand pounds.  This depletion has caused a denial to the consuming public of constant and adequate supply of these vitamin rich foods within a reasonable price range that consistent and abundant supply would make possible, and has caused decline and instability in the fishing industry in this river system.  The restoration of this species in the Delaware River has become an enterprise of vast economic importance to this Commonwealth.


(3) It is a matter of public interest and for the public welfare and health for the Commonwealth to take such measures as are necessary to control the intensity of fishing pressure in order that the restoration of this valuable species may be accomplished and that the species may attain the maximum sustained yield consistent with the preservation of an adequate brood stock.  Legislative limitation of the size of the mesh of nets, size limits and other like measures are not effective in conserving this species.


(4) In accordance with the purposes of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Compact to which this Commonwealth is a party and in order to carry out the policy of the Commonwealth as it relates to the shad inhabiting the waters of the Delaware River and in order to restore this depleted fishery, it is necessary, proper and expedient to establish a system of licensing designed to control increases in the intensity of fishing pressure so that increases in fishing pressure will be brought into balance with the population of shad in the Delaware, to the end that the shad fisheries of the waters of the Delaware River and its tributaries will be restored and will produce the maximum sustained yield consistent with the conservation of that species.  Since the stabilization of fishing operations is an activity promoting the public interest, the payment of license fees and the imposing and controlling of the restrictive provisions of this chapter upon the general public is an equitable contribution on its part arising from the privileges of harvesting this natural resource.

(3) Current telecommunications development efforts, which are the key to the economies of the future, have not been coordinated.  This has resulted in duplication of efforts in some areas of this Commonwealth and the exclusion of many rural areas in telecommunications development.

(vi) to projects for financing working capital.


(3) It is the intent of this chapter in specifying and defining the authorized purposes and projects of an authority to permit the authority to benefit the people of this Commonwealth by, among other things, increasing their commerce, health, safety and prosperity while not unnecessarily burdening or interfering with any municipality which has not incorporated or joined that authority.  Therefore, notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, an authority shall not have as its purpose and shall not undertake as a project solely for revenue-producing purposes the acquiring of buildings, facilities or tracts of land which in the case of an authority incorporated or joined by a county or counties are located either within or outside the boundaries of the county or counties and in the case of all other authorities are located outside the boundaries of the municipality or municipalities that incorporated or joined the authority unless either:

(i) the governing body of each municipality in which the project will be undertaken has by resolution evidenced its approval;  or


(ii) in cases where the property acquired is not subject to tax abatement, the authority covenants and agrees with each municipality in which the authority will acquire real property as part of the project either to make annual payments in lieu of real estate taxes and special assessments for amounts and time periods specified in the agreement or to pay annually the amount of real estate taxes and special assessments which would be payable if the real property so acquired were fully taxable and subject to special assessments.



(i) the governing body of each municipality in which the project will be undertaken has by resolution evidenced its approval;  or


(ii) in cases where the property acquired is not subject to tax abatement, the authority covenants and agrees with each municipality in which the authority will acquire real property as part of the project either to make annual payments in lieu of real estate taxes and special assessments for amounts and time periods specified in the agreement or to pay annually the amount of real estate taxes and special assessments which would be payable if the real property so acquired were fully taxable and subject to special assessments.


(c) Effect of specificity.--The municipality or municipalities organizing such an authority may, in the resolution or ordinance signifying their intention so to do or from time to time by subsequent resolution or ordinance, specify the project or projects to be undertaken by the authority, and no other projects shall be undertaken by the authority than those so specified.  If the municipal authorities organizing an authority fail to specify the project or projects to be undertaken, then the authority shall be deemed to have all the powers granted by this chapter.


(d) Powers.--Every authority may exercise all powers necessary or convenient for the carrying out of the purposes set forth in this section, including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following rights and powers:

(1) To have existence for a term of 50 years and for such further period or periods as may be provided in articles of amendment approved under section 5605(e) (relating to amendment of articles).


(2) To sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded, complain and defend in all courts.


(3) To adopt, use and alter at will a corporate seal.


(4) To acquire, purchase, hold, lease as lessee and use any franchise, property, real, personal or mixed, tangible or intangible, or any interest therein necessary or desirable for carrying out the purposes of the authority, and to sell, lease as lessor, transfer and dispose of any property or interest therein at any time acquired by it.


(5) To acquire by purchase, lease or otherwise and to construct, improve, maintain, repair and operate projects.


(6) To finance projects by making loans which may be evidenced by and secured as may be provided in loan agreements, mortgages, security agreements or any other contracts, instruments or agreements, which contracts, instruments or agreements may contain such provisions as the authority shall deem necessary or desirable for the security or protection of the authority or its bondholders.


(7) To make bylaws for the management and regulation of its affairs.


(8) To appoint officers, agents, employees and servants, to prescribe their duties and to fix their compensation.


(9) To fix, alter, charge and collect rates and other charges in the area served by its facilities at reasonable and uniform rates to be determined exclusively by it for the purpose of providing for the payment of the expenses of the authority, the construction, improvement, repair, maintenance and operation of its facilities and properties and, in the case of an authority created for the purpose of making business improvements or providing administrative services, a charge for such services which is to be based on actual benefits and which may be measured on, among other things, gross sales or gross or net profits, the payment of the principal of and interest on its obligations and to fulfill the terms and provisions of any agreements made with the purchasers or holders of any such obligations, or with a municipality and to determine by itself exclusively the services and improvements required to provide adequate, safe and reasonable service, including extensions thereof, in the areas served.  If the service area includes more than one municipality, the revenues from any project shall not be expended directly or indirectly on any other project unless such expenditures are made for the benefit of the entire service area.  Any person questioning the reasonableness or uniformity of a rate fixed by an authority or the adequacy, safety and reasonableness of the authority's services, including extensions thereof, may bring suit against the authority in the court of common pleas of the county where the project is located or, if the project is located in more than one county, in the court of common pleas of the county where the principal office of the project is located.  The court of common pleas shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine questions involving rates or service.  Except in municipal corporations having a population density of 300 persons or more per square mile, all owners of real property in eighth class counties may decline in writing the services of a solid waste authority.


(10) In the case of an authority which has agreed to provide water service through a separate meter and separate service line to a residential dwelling unit in which the owner does not reside, to impose and enforce the owner's duty to pay a tenant's bill for service rendered to the tenant by the authority only if the authority notifies the owner and the tenant within 30 days after the bill first becomes overdue.  Notification shall be provided by first class mail to the address of the owner provided to the authority by the owner and to the billing address of the tenant, respectively.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require an authority to terminate service to a tenant, and the owner shall not be liable for any service which the authority provides to the tenant 90 or more days after the tenant's bill first becomes due unless the authority has been prevented by court order from terminating service to that tenant.


(11) In the case of an authority which has agreed to provide sewer service to a residential dwelling unit in which the owner does not reside, to impose and enforce the owner's duty to pay a tenant's bill for service rendered by the authority to the tenant.  The authority shall notify the owner and the tenant within 30 days after the tenant's bill for that service first becomes overdue.  Notification shall be provided by first class mail to the address of the owner provided to the authority by the owner and to the billing address of the tenant, respectively.  Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to relieve the owner of liability for such service unless the authority fails to provide the notice required in this paragraph.


(12) To borrow money, make and issue negotiable notes, bonds, refunding bonds and other evidences of indebtedness or obligations, hereinafter called bonds, of the authority.  Bonds shall have a maturity date not longer than 40 years from the date of issue except that no refunding bonds shall have a maturity date later than the life of the authority;  also, to secure the payment of the bonds or any part thereof by pledge or deed of trust of all or any of its revenues and receipts;  to make agreements with the purchasers or holders of the bonds or with others in connection with any bonds, whether issued or to be issued, as the authority shall deem advisable;  and in general to provide for the security for the bonds and the rights of the bondholders.  In respect to any project constructed and operated under agreement with any authority or any public authority of any adjoining state, to borrow money and issue notes, bonds and other evidences of indebtedness and obligations jointly with that authority.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, no authority shall borrow money on obligations to be paid primarily out of lease rentals or other current revenues other than charges made to the public for the use of the capital projects financed if the net debt of the lessee municipality or municipalities shall exceed any limit provided by any law of the Commonwealth.


(13) To make contracts of every name and nature and to execute all instruments necessary or convenient for the carrying on of its business.


(14) Without limitation of the foregoing, to borrow money and accept grants from and to enter into contracts, leases or other transactions with any Federal agency, the Commonwealth or a municipality, school district, corporation or authority.


(15) To have the power of eminent domain.


(16) To pledge, hypothecate or otherwise encumber all or any of the revenues or receipts of the authority as security for all or any of the obligations of the authority.


(17) To do all acts and things necessary or convenient for the promotion of its business and the general welfare of the authority to carry out the powers granted to it by this chapter or other law, including, but not limited to, the adoption of reasonable rules and regulations that apply to water and sewer lines located on a property owned or leased by a customer and to refer for prosecution as a summary offense any violation dealing with rules and regulations relating to water and sewer lines located on a property owned or leased by a customer.  Under this paragraph, an authority established by a county of the second class A which is not a home rule county shall have powers for the inspection and repair of sewer facilities comparable to the powers of health officials under section 3007 of the act of May 1, 1933 (P.L. 103, No. 69),   1 known as The Second Class Township Code.


(18) To contract with any municipality, corporation or a public authority of this and an adjoining state on terms as the authority shall deem proper for the construction and operation of any project which is partly in this Commonwealth and partly in the adjoining state.


(19) To enter into contracts to supply water and other services to and for municipalities that are not members of the authority or to and for the Commonwealth, municipalities, school districts, persons or authorities and fix the amount to be paid therefor.



(20) (i) To make contracts of insurance with an insurance company, association or exchange authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth, insuring its employees and appointed officers and officials under a policy or policies of insurance covering life, accidental death and dismemberment and disability income.  Statutory requirements for such insurance, including, but not limited to, requisite number of eligible employees, appointed officers and officials, as provided for in section 621.2 of the act of May 17, 1921 (P.L. 682, No. 284), known as The Insurance Company Law of 1921, and sections 1, 2, 6, 7 and 9 of the act of May 11, 1949 (P.L. 1210, No. 367), known as the Group Life Insurance Policy Law, shall be met.


(ii) To make contracts with an insurance company, association or exchange or any hospital plan corporation or professional health service corporation authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth insuring or covering its employees and their dependents but not its appointed officers and officials nor their dependents for hospital and medical benefits and to contract for its employees but not its appointed officers and officials with an insurance company, association or exchange authorized to transact business in this Commonwealth granting annuities or to establish, maintain, operate and administer its own pension plan covering its employees but not its appointed officers and officials.


(iii) For the purposes set forth under this paragraph, to agree to pay part or all of the cost of this insurance, including the premiums or charges for carrying these contracts, and to appropriate out of its treasury any money necessary to pay such costs, premiums or charges.  The proper officers of the authority who are authorized to enter into such contracts are authorized, enabled and permitted to deduct from the officers' or employees' pay, salary or compensation that part of the premium or cost which is payable by the officer or employee and as may be so authorized by the officer or employee in writing.



(21) To charge the cost of construction of any sewer or water main constructed by the authority against the properties benefited, improved or accommodated thereby to the extent of such benefits.  These benefits shall be assessed in the manner provided under this chapter for the exercise of the right of eminent domain.


(22) To charge the cost of construction of a sewer or water main constructed by the authority against the properties benefited, improved or accommodated by the construction according to the foot front rule.  Charges shall be based upon the foot frontage of the properties benefited and shall be a lien against such properties.  Charges may be assessed and collected and liens may be enforced in the manner provided by law for the assessment and collection of charges and the enforcement of liens of the municipality in which such authority is located.  No charge shall be assessed unless prior to the construction of a sewer or water main the authority submitted the plan of construction and estimated cost to the municipality in which the project is to be undertaken and the municipality approved it.  The properties benefited, improved or accommodated by the construction may not be charged an aggregate amount in excess of the approved estimated cost.


(23) To require the posting of financial security to insure the completion in accordance with the approved plat and with the rules and regulations of the authority of any water mains or sanitary sewer lines, or both, and related apparatus and facilities required to be installed by or on behalf of a developer under an approved land development or subdivision plat as these terms are defined under the act of July 31, 1968 (P.L. 805, No. 247),  2 known as the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code.  If financial security is required by the authority and without limitation as to other types of financial security which the authority may approve, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, federally chartered or Commonwealth-chartered lending institution irrevocable letters of credit and restrictive or escrow accounts in these lending institutions shall be deemed acceptable financial security.  Financial security shall be posted with a bonding company or federally chartered or Commonwealth-chartered lending institution chosen by the party posting the financial security if the bonding company or lending institution is authorized to conduct business within this Commonwealth.  The bond or other security shall provide for and secure to the authority the completion of required improvements within one year from the date of posting of the security.  The amount of financial security shall be equal to 110% of the cost of the required improvements for which financial security is to be posted.  The cost of required improvements shall be established by submitting to the authority a bona fide bid from a contractor chosen by the party posting the financial security.  In the absence of a bona fide bid, the cost shall be established by an estimate prepared by the authority's engineer.  If the party posting the financial security requires more than one year from the date of posting the financial security to complete the required improvements, the amount of financial security may be increased by an additional 10% for each one-year period beyond the first anniversary date from the initial posting date or to 110% of the cost of completing the required improvements as reestablished on or about the expiration of the preceding one-year period by using the above bidding procedure.  As the work of installing the required improvements proceeds, the party posting the financial security may request the authority to release or authorize the release of, from time to time, portions of the financial security necessary to pay the contractor performing the work.  Release requests shall be in writing addressed to the authority, and the authority shall have 45 days after receiving a request to ascertain from the authority engineer, certified in writing, that the portion of the work has been completed in accordance with the approved plat.  Upon receiving written certification, the authority shall authorize release by the bonding company or lending institution of an amount estimated by the authority engineer to fairly represent the value of the improvements completed.  If the authority fails to act within the 45-day period, it shall be deemed to have approved the requested release of funds.  The authority may, prior to final release at the time of completion and certification by its engineer, retain 10% of the original amount of the posted financial security for the improvements.  If the authority accepts dedication of all or some of the required improvements following completion, it may require the posting of financial security to secure structural integrity of the dedicated improvements as well as the functioning of the improvements in accordance with the design and specifications as depicted on the final plat and the authority's rules and regulations.  This financial security shall expire not later than 18 months from the date of acceptance of dedication and shall be of the same type as set forth in this paragraph with regard to that which is required for installation of the improvements, except that it shall not exceed 15% of the actual cost of installation of the improvements.  Any inconsistent ordinance, resolution or statute is null and void.


(24) To charge enumerated fees to property owners who desire to or are required to connect to the authority's sewer or water system.  Fees shall be based upon the duly adopted fee schedule which is in effect at the time of payment and shall be payable at the time of application for connection or at a time to which the property owner and the authority agree.  In the case of projects to serve existing development, fees shall be payable at a time to be determined by the authority.  An authority may require that no capacity be guaranteed for a property owner until the tapping fees have been paid or secured by other financial security.  The fees shall be in addition to any charges assessed against the property in the construction of a sewer or water main by the authority under paragraphs (21) and (22) as well as any other user charges imposed by the authority under paragraph (9), except that no reservation of capacity fee or other similar charge shall be imposed or collected from a property owner who has applied for service unless the charge is based on debt and fixed operating expenses.  A reservation of capacity fee or other similar charge may not exceed 60% of the average sanitary sewer bill for a residential customer in the same sewer service area for the same billing period.  Any authority opting to collect a reservation of capacity fee or other similar charge may not collect the tapping fee until the time as the building permit fee is due.  Tapping fees shall not include costs included in the calculation of any other fees, assessments, rates or other charges imposed under this act.

(i) The fees may include any of the following if they are separately set forth in a resolution adopted by the authority:

(A) Connection fee.  A connection fee shall not exceed an amount based upon the actual cost of the connection of the property extending from the authority's main to the property line or curb stop of the property connected.  The authority may also base the connection fee upon an average cost for previously installed connections of similar type and size.  Such average cost may be trended to current cost using published cost indexes.  In lieu of payment of the fee, an authority may require the construction of those facilities by the property owner who requested the connection.


(B) Customer facilities fee.  A customer facilities fee shall not exceed an amount based upon the actual cost of facilities serving the connected property from the property line or curb stop to the proposed dwelling or building to be served.  The fee shall be chargeable only if the authority installs the customer facilities.  In lieu of payment of the customer facilities fee, an authority may require the construction of those facilities by the property owner who requests customer facilities.  In the case of water service, the fee may include the cost of a water meter and installation if the authority provides or installs the water meter.  If the property connected or to be connected with the sewer system of the authority is not equipped with a water meter, the authority may install a meter at its own cost and expense.  If the property is supplied with water from the facilities of a public water supply agency, the authority shall not install a meter without the consent and approval of the public water supply agency.


(C) Tapping fee.  A tapping fee shall not exceed an amount based upon some or all of the following parts which shall be separately set forth in the resolution adopted by the authority to establish these fees.  In lieu of payment of this fee, an authority may require the construction and dedication of only such capacity, distribution-collection or special purpose facilities necessary to supply service to the property owner or owners.

(I) Capacity part.  The capacity part shall not exceed an amount that is based upon the cost of capacity-related facilities, including, but not limited to, source of supply, treatment, pumping, transmission, trunk, interceptor and outfall mains, storage, sludge treatment or disposal, interconnection or other general system facilities.  Except as specifically provided in this paragraph, such facilities may include only those that provide existing service.  The cost of capacity-related facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon their historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities.  To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of current replacement cost.  Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable.  Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers.  The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section.  For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities.  The capacity part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of said facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the total cost of the facilities as described herein divided by the system design capacity of all such facilities.  Where the cost of facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future are included in the calculation of the capacity part as permitted herein, the total cost of the facilities shall be divided by the system design capacity plus the additional capacity to be provided by the facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future.  An authority may allocate its capacity-related facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional capacity-related tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers.  The cost of facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future that will increase the system design capacity may be included in the calculation of the capacity part, subject to the provisions of clause (VI).  The cost of such facilities shall not exceed their reasonable estimated cost set forth in a duly adopted annual budget or a five-year capital improvement plan.  The authority shall have taken at least two of the following actions toward construction of the facilities:

(a) obtained financing for the facilities;


(b) entered into a contract obligating the authority to construct or pay for the cost of construction of the facilities or its portion thereof in the event that multiple parties are constructing the facilities;


(c) obtained a permit for the facilities;


(d) obtained title to or condemned additional real estate upon which the facilities will be constructed;


(e) entered into a contract obligating the authority to purchase or acquire facilities owned by another;


(f) prepared an engineering feasibility study specifically related to the facilities, which study recommends the construction of the facilities within a five-year period;  


(g) entered into a contract for the design or construction of the facilities or adopted a budget which includes the use of in-house resources for the design or construction of the facilities.



(II) Distribution or collection part.  The distribution or collection part may not exceed an amount based upon the cost of distribution or collection facilities required to provide service, such as mains, hydrants and pumping stations.  Facilities may only include those that provide existing service.  The cost of distribution or collections facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities.  To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of replacement cost.  Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable. Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers.  The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section.  For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities.  The distribution or collection part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of said facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the cost of the facilities divided by the design capacity.  An authority may allocate its distribution- related or collection-related facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional distribution-related or collection- related tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers.


(III) Special purpose part.  A part for special purpose facilities shall be applicable only to a particular group of customers or for serving a particular purpose or a specific area based upon the cost of the facilities, including, but not limited to, booster pump stations, fire service facilities, water or sewer mains, pumping stations and industrial wastewater treatment facilities.  Such facilities may include only those that provide existing service.  The cost of special purpose facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities.  To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of current replacement cost.  Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable.  Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers.  The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section.  For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities.  The special purpose part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of such special purpose facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the cost of the facilities as described herein divided by the design capacity of the facilities.  Where an authority constructs special purpose facilities at its own expense, the design capacity for the facilities may be expressed in terms of the number of equivalent dwelling units to be served by the facilities.  In no event shall an authority continue to collect any tapping fee which includes a special purpose part after special purpose part fees have been imposed on the total number of design capacity units used in the original calculation of the special purpose part.  An authority may allocate its special purpose facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional special purpose tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers.


(IV) Reimbursement part.  The reimbursement part shall only be applicable to the users of certain specific facilities when a fee required to be collected from such users will be reimbursed to the person at whose expense the facilities were constructed as set forth in a written agreement between the authority and such person at whose expense such facilities were constructed.


(V) Calculation of tapping fee.

(a) In arriving at the cost to be included in the tapping fee, the same cost shall not be included in more than one part of the tapping fee.


(b) No tapping fee may be based upon or include the cost of expanding, replacing, updating or upgrading facilities serving only existing customers in order to meet stricter efficiency, environmental, regulatory or safety standards or to provide better service to or meet the needs of existing customers.


(c) The cost used in calculating tapping fees shall not include maintenance and operation expenses.


(d) As used in this subclause, “maintenance and operation expenses” are those expenditures made during the useful life of a sewer or water system for labor, materials, utilities, equipment accessories, appurtenances and other items which are necessary to manage and maintain the system capacity and performance and to provide the service for which the system was constructed. Costs or expenses to reduce or eliminate groundwater infiltration or inflow may not be included in the cost of facilities used to calculate tapping fees unless these costs or expenses result in an increase in system design capacity.


(e) Except as otherwise provided for the calculation of a special purpose part, the design capacity required by a new residential customer used in calculating sewer or water tapping fees shall not exceed an amount established by multiplying 65 gallons per capita per day for water capacity, 90 gallons per capita per day for sewer capacity times the average number of persons per household as established by the most recent census data provided by the United States Census Bureau.  If an authority service area is entirely within a municipal boundary for which there is corresponding census data specifying the average number of persons per household, issued by the United States Census Bureau, the average shall be used.  If an authority service area is not entirely within a municipal boundary but is entirely within a county or other geographic area within Pennsylvania for which the United States Census Bureau has provided the average number of persons per household, then that average for the county or geographic area shall be used.  If an authority service area is not entirely within a municipal, county or other geographic area within Pennsylvania for which the United States Census Bureau has calculated an average number of persons per household, then the Pennsylvania average number of persons per household shall be used as published by the United States Census Bureau.  Alternatively, the design capacity required for a new residential customer shall be determined by a study but shall not exceed:

(i) for water capacity, the average residential water consumption per residential customer, or, for sewage capacity, the average residential water consumption per residential customer plus ten percent.  The average residential water consumption shall be determined by dividing the total water consumption for all metered residential customers in the authority's service area over at least a 12-consecutive-month period within the most recent five years by the average number of customers during the period;  or


(ii) for sewer capacity, the average sewage flow per residential customer determined by a measured sewage flow study.  Such study shall be completed in accordance with sound engineering practices within the most recent five years for the lesser of three or all residential subdivisions of more than ten lots which have collection systems in good repair and which connected to the authority's facilities within the most recent five years.  The study shall calculate the average sewage flow per residential customer in such developments by measuring actual sewage flows over at least 12 consecutive months at the points where such developments connected to the authority's sewer main.


(iii) All data and other information considered or obtained by an authority in connection with determining capacity under this subsection shall be made available to the public upon request.


(iv) If any person required to pay a tapping fee submits to the authority an opinion from a professional engineer that challenges the validity of the results of the calculation of design capacity required to serve new residential customers prepared under subparagraph (i) or (ii), the authority shall within 30 days obtain a written certification from another professional engineer, who is not an employee of the authority, verifying that the results and the calculations, methodology and measurement were performed in accordance with this title   3 and generally accepted engineering practices.  If an authority does not obtain a certification required under this subsection within 30 days of receiving such challenge, the authority may not impose or collect tapping fees based on any such challenged calculations or study until such engineering certification is obtained.



(f) An authority may use lower design capacity requirements and impose lower tapping fees for multifamily residential dwellings than imposed on other types of residential customers.



(VI) Separate accounting for future facility costs.  Any portion of tapping fees collected which, based on facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future in accordance with this section, shall be separately accounted for and shall be expended only for that particular facility or a substitute facility accomplishing the same purpose which is commenced within the same period.  Such accounting shall include, but not be limited to, the total fees collected as a result of including facilities to be constructed in the future, the source of the fees collected and the amount of fees expended on specific facilities.  The proportionate share of tapping fees based upon facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future under this section shall be refunded to the payor of such fees within 90 days of the occurrence of the following:

(a) the authority abandons its plan or a part thereof to construct or acquire a facility or facilities which are the basis for such fee;  or


(b) the facilities have not been placed into service within seven years, or, for an authority which provides service to five or more municipalities, the facilities have not been placed into service within 20 years, after adoption of a resolution which imposes tapping fees which are based upon facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future.  Any refund of fees held for 20 years shall include interest for the period the money was held.



(VII) Definitions.  As used in this clause, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subclause:
“BOD5.” The five-day biochemical-oxygen demand.
“Design capacity.”  For residential customers, the permitted or rated capacity of facilities expressed in million gallons per day.  For nonresidential customers, design capacity may also be expressed in pounds of BOD5 per day, pounds of suspended solids per day or any other capacity-defining parameter that is separately and specifically set forth in the permit governing the operation of the system and based upon its original design as modified by those regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over these facilities.  Additionally, for separate fire service customers, the permitted or rated capacity of fire service facilities may be expressed in peak flows.  The units of measurement used to express design capacity shall be the same units of measurement used to express the system design capacity.  Except as otherwise provided for special purpose facilities, design capacity may not be expressed in terms of equivalent dwelling units.
“Outstanding debt.”  The principal amount outstanding of any bonds, notes, loans or other form of indebtedness used to finance or refinance facilities included in the tapping fee.

“System design capacity.”  The design capacity of the system for which the tapping fee is being calculated which represents the total design capacity of the treatment facility or water sources.




(ii) Every authority charging a tapping, customer facilities or connection fee shall do so only pursuant to a resolution adopted at a public meeting of the authority.  The authority shall have available for public inspection a detailed itemization of all calculations, clearly showing the maximum fees allowable for each part of the tapping fee and the manner in which the fees were determined, which shall be made a part of any resolution imposing such fees.  A tapping, customer facilities or connection fee may be revised and imposed upon those who subsequently connect to the system, subject to the provisions and limitations of the act.


(iii) No authority shall have the power to impose a connection fee, customer facilities fee, tapping fee or similar fee except as provided specifically under this section.


(iv) A municipality or municipal authority with available excess sewage capacity, wishing to sell a portion of that capacity to another municipality or municipal authority, may not charge a higher cost for the capacity portion of the tapping fee as the selling entity charges to its customers for the capacity portion of the tapping fee.  In turn, the municipality or municipal authority buying this excess capacity may not charge a higher cost for the capacity portion of the tapping fee to its residential customers than that charged to them by the selling entity.


(v) As used in this paragraph, the term “residential customer” shall also include those developing property for residential dwellings that require multiple tapping fee permits.  This paragraph shall not be applicable to intermunicipal or interauthority agreements relative to the purchase of excess capacity by an authority or municipality in effect prior to February 20, 2001.

(A) The authority may determine an assessment determined by multiplying the total improvement and service cost by the ratio of the assessed value for real estate tax purposes of the benefited property to the total assessed value of all benefited properties in the district.


(B) The authority may determine assessments upon the several properties in the district in proportion to benefits as ascertained by viewers appointed in accordance with municipal law.

(III) The district assessment shall be calculated on each benefited single-family residential property, benefited residential cooperative property and benefited unit owners' association by multiplying in each case the total improvement and services cost by the ratio of the district assessed value of the benefited single-family residential property, benefited residential cooperative property or benefited unit owners' association to the sum of the district assessed value of all benefited single-family residential properties, the district assessed value of all residential cooperative properties, the district assessed value of all benefited unit owners' associations and the assessed value of all remaining benefited properties in the business improvement district.


(IV) The remaining benefited properties shall be assessed by multiplying in each case the total improvement and services cost by the ratio of the assessed value of the remaining benefited property to the sum of the district assessed value of all benefited single-family residential properties, the district assessed value of all residential cooperative properties, the district assessed value of all benefited unit owners' associations and the assessed value of all remaining benefited properties in the business improvement district.


(V) An election by an authority under this clause shall not be revoked except through the procedures stated in subparagraph (ii) and subsection (g).

68 Pa.C.S. § 3319
 (relating to other liens affecting the condominium), provided that if an assessment against a unit owners' association is paid in part and the unit owners' association specifies in writing to the authority the units with respect to which full payment was made, the claim shall not be enforceable against units with respect to which full payment was made or against the unit owners' association.  An authority shall discharge a lien against a unit owners' association to the extent that it constitutes a lien on a particular unit upon proof of payment, either to the unit owners' association or to the authority, by the owner of the particular unit of his itemized share of the assessment on the unit owners' association.


(x) An authority that has made an election under subparagraph (i)(C) may further elect to calculate, for the assessment years included in a plan and budget, the assessments on single-family residential properties, including those that are part of a planned unit development, residential cooperative properties and residential condominium properties, at the lower of the amount determined under subparagraph (i)(C) or that aggregate value of assessments that will not exceed 5% of the authority's total annual assessments, subject to the following:

(A) Any aggregate reduction in assessments on residential properties shall increase the assessments on the remaining properties in proportion to the assessments of the remaining properties calculated under subparagraph (i)(C)(IV).


(B) Any further election shall be made for all assessment years included in a plan and budget, except that, for a current plan and budget, the further election shall be made for the years remaining in the plan and budget.  Once made, the further election shall remain in effect for all such assessment years included in the plan and budget.

Pt. II Subpt. B, the condominium association and all condominium units shall be treated as one property, valued in the manner described in subparagraph (i)(C)(II).  Any objection must be made within 30 days of the hearing in writing signed by the property owner and filed in the registered office of the authority.

(ii) If, within 60 days from the date of billing, the authority and the property owner cannot agree on the amount of billings which are reasonable and necessary, the property owner shall have the right to request the appointment of another professional consultant to serve as arbitrator.  The property owner and the authority whose fees are being challenged shall, by mutual agreement, appoint a professional of the same profession or discipline licensed in Pennsylvania to review the billings and make a determination as to the amount of billings which is reasonable and necessary.

(B) impose a surcharge of 4% of the amount found as unreasonable or excessive to be paid to the party that paid the disputed fee.

(i) Reimbursement shall be equal to the distribution or collection part of each tapping fee collected as a result of subsequent connections.  An authority may deduct from each reimbursement payment an amount equal to 5% of it for administrative expenses and services rendered in calculating, collecting, monitoring and disbursing the reimbursement payments to the property owner.


(ii) Reimbursement shall be limited to those lines which have not previously been paid for by the authority.


(iii) The authority shall, in preparing necessary reimbursement agreements with a property owner for whose benefit reimbursement will be provided, attach as an exhibit an itemized listing of all sewer and water facilities for which reimbursement shall be provided.


(iv) The total reimbursement which a property owner may receive may not exceed the cost of labor and material, engineering design charges, the cost of performance and maintenance bonds, authority review and inspection charges as well as flushing and televising charges and any and all charges involved in the acceptance and dedication of such facilities by the authority, less the amount which would be chargeable to the property owner based upon the authority's collection and distribution tapping fees which would be applicable to all lands of the property owner directly or indirectly served through extensions if the property owner did not fund the extension.


(v) An authority shall notify by certified mail, to the last known address, the property owner for whose benefit a reimbursement shall apply.  This shall be done within 30 days of the authority's receipt of the reimbursement payment.  If a property owner does not claim a reimbursement payment within 120 days after the mailing of the notice, the payment shall become the sole property of the authority with no further obligation on the part of the authority to refund the payment to the property owner.

(24) To charge enumerated fees to property owners who desire to or are required to connect to the authority's sewer or water system.  Fees shall be based upon the duly adopted fee schedule which is in effect at the time of payment and shall be payable at the time of application for connection or at a time to which the property owner and the authority agree.  In the case of projects to serve existing development, fees shall be payable at a time to be determined by the authority.  An authority may require that no capacity be guaranteed for a property owner until the tapping fees have been paid or secured by other financial security.  The fees shall be in addition to any charges assessed against the property in the construction of a sewer or water main by the authority under paragraphs (21) and (22) as well as any other user charges imposed by the authority under paragraph (9), except that no reservation of capacity fee or other similar charge shall be imposed or collected from a property owner who has applied for service unless the charge is based on debt and fixed operating expenses.  A reservation of capacity fee or other similar charge may not exceed 60% of the average sanitary sewer bill for a residential customer in the same sewer service area for the same billing period.  Any authority opting to collect a reservation of capacity fee or other similar charge may not collect the tapping fee until the time as the building permit fee is due.  Tapping fees shall not include costs included in the calculation of any other fees, assessments, rates or other charges imposed under this act.

(i) The fees may include any of the following if they are separately set forth in a resolution adopted by the authority:

(A) Connection fee.  A connection fee shall not exceed an amount based upon the actual cost of the connection of the property extending from the authority's main to the property line or curb stop of the property connected.  The authority may also base the connection fee upon an average cost for previously installed connections of similar type and size.  Such average cost may be trended to current cost using published cost indexes.  In lieu of payment of the fee, an authority may require the construction of those facilities by the property owner who requested the connection.


(B) Customer facilities fee.  A customer facilities fee shall not exceed an amount based upon the actual cost of facilities serving the connected property from the property line or curb stop to the proposed dwelling or building to be served.  The fee shall be chargeable only if the authority installs the customer facilities.  In lieu of payment of the customer facilities fee, an authority may require the construction of those facilities by the property owner who requests customer facilities.  In the case of water service, the fee may include the cost of a water meter and installation if the authority provides or installs the water meter.  If the property connected or to be connected with the sewer system of the authority is not equipped with a water meter, the authority may install a meter at its own cost and expense.  If the property is supplied with water from the facilities of a public water supply agency, the authority shall not install a meter without the consent and approval of the public water supply agency.


(C) Tapping fee.  A tapping fee shall not exceed an amount based upon some or all of the following parts which shall be separately set forth in the resolution adopted by the authority to establish these fees.  In lieu of payment of this fee, an authority may require the construction and dedication of only such capacity, distribution-collection or special purpose facilities necessary to supply service to the property owner or owners.

(I) Capacity part.  The capacity part shall not exceed an amount that is based upon the cost of capacity-related facilities, including, but not limited to, source of supply, treatment, pumping, transmission, trunk, interceptor and outfall mains, storage, sludge treatment or disposal, interconnection or other general system facilities.  Except as specifically provided in this paragraph, such facilities may include only those that provide existing service.  The cost of capacity-related facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon their historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities.  To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of current replacement cost.  Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable.  Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers.  The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section.  For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities.  The capacity part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of said facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the total cost of the facilities as described herein divided by the system design capacity of all such facilities.  Where the cost of facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future are included in the calculation of the capacity part as permitted herein, the total cost of the facilities shall be divided by the system design capacity plus the additional capacity to be provided by the facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future.  An authority may allocate its capacity-related facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional capacity-related tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers.  The cost of facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future that will increase the system design capacity may be included in the calculation of the capacity part, subject to the provisions of clause (VI).  The cost of such facilities shall not exceed their reasonable estimated cost set forth in a duly adopted annual budget or a five-year capital improvement plan.  The authority shall have taken at least two of the following actions toward construction of the facilities:

(a) obtained financing for the facilities;


(b) entered into a contract obligating the authority to construct or pay for the cost of construction of the facilities or its portion thereof in the event that multiple parties are constructing the facilities;


(c) obtained a permit for the facilities;


(d) obtained title to or condemned additional real estate upon which the facilities will be constructed;


(e) entered into a contract obligating the authority to purchase or acquire facilities owned by another;


(f) prepared an engineering feasibility study specifically related to the facilities, which study recommends the construction of the facilities within a five-year period;  


(g) entered into a contract for the design or construction of the facilities or adopted a budget which includes the use of in-house resources for the design or construction of the facilities.



(II) Distribution or collection part.  The distribution or collection part may not exceed an amount based upon the cost of distribution or collection facilities required to provide service, such as mains, hydrants and pumping stations.  Facilities may only include those that provide existing service.  The cost of distribution or collections facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities.  To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of replacement cost.  Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable. Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers.  The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section.  For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities.  The distribution or collection part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of said facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the cost of the facilities divided by the design capacity.  An authority may allocate its distribution- related or collection-related facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional distribution-related or collection- related tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers.


(III) Special purpose part.  A part for special purpose facilities shall be applicable only to a particular group of customers or for serving a particular purpose or a specific area based upon the cost of the facilities, including, but not limited to, booster pump stations, fire service facilities, water or sewer mains, pumping stations and industrial wastewater treatment facilities.  Such facilities may include only those that provide existing service.  The cost of special purpose facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities.  To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of current replacement cost.  Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable.  Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers.  The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section.  For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities.  The special purpose part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of such special purpose facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the cost of the facilities as described herein divided by the design capacity of the facilities.  Where an authority constructs special purpose facilities at its own expense, the design capacity for the facilities may be expressed in terms of the number of equivalent dwelling units to be served by the facilities.  In no event shall an authority continue to collect any tapping fee which includes a special purpose part after special purpose part fees have been imposed on the total number of design capacity units used in the original calculation of the special purpose part.  An authority may allocate its special purpose facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional special purpose tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers.


(IV) Reimbursement part.  The reimbursement part shall only be applicable to the users of certain specific facilities when a fee required to be collected from such users will be reimbursed to the person at whose expense the facilities were constructed as set forth in a written agreement between the authority and such person at whose expense such facilities were constructed.


(V) Calculation of tapping fee.

(a) In arriving at the cost to be included in the tapping fee, the same cost shall not be included in more than one part of the tapping fee.


(b) No tapping fee may be based upon or include the cost of expanding, replacing, updating or upgrading facilities serving only existing customers in order to meet stricter efficiency, environmental, regulatory or safety standards or to provide better service to or meet the needs of existing customers.


(c) The cost used in calculating tapping fees shall not include maintenance and operation expenses.


(d) As used in this subclause, “maintenance and operation expenses” are those expenditures made during the useful life of a sewer or water system for labor, materials, utilities, equipment accessories, appurtenances and other items which are necessary to manage and maintain the system capacity and performance and to provide the service for which the system was constructed. Costs or expenses to reduce or eliminate groundwater infiltration or inflow may not be included in the cost of facilities used to calculate tapping fees unless these costs or expenses result in an increase in system design capacity.


(e) Except as otherwise provided for the calculation of a special purpose part, the design capacity required by a new residential customer used in calculating sewer or water tapping fees shall not exceed an amount established by multiplying 65 gallons per capita per day for water capacity, 90 gallons per capita per day for sewer capacity times the average number of persons per household as established by the most recent census data provided by the United States Census Bureau.  If an authority service area is entirely within a municipal boundary for which there is corresponding census data specifying the average number of persons per household, issued by the United States Census Bureau, the average shall be used.  If an authority service area is not entirely within a municipal boundary but is entirely within a county or other geographic area within Pennsylvania for which the United States Census Bureau has provided the average number of persons per household, then that average for the county or geographic area shall be used.  If an authority service area is not entirely within a municipal, county or other geographic area within Pennsylvania for which the United States Census Bureau has calculated an average number of persons per household, then the Pennsylvania average number of persons per household shall be used as published by the United States Census Bureau.  Alternatively, the design capacity required for a new residential customer shall be determined by a study but shall not exceed:

(i) for water capacity, the average residential water consumption per residential customer, or, for sewage capacity, the average residential water consumption per residential customer plus ten percent.  The average residential water consumption shall be determined by dividing the total water consumption for all metered residential customers in the authority's service area over at least a 12-consecutive-month period within the most recent five years by the average number of customers during the period;  or


(ii) for sewer capacity, the average sewage flow per residential customer determined by a measured sewage flow study.  Such study shall be completed in accordance with sound engineering practices within the most recent five years for the lesser of three or all residential subdivisions of more than ten lots which have collection systems in good repair and which connected to the authority's facilities within the most recent five years.  The study shall calculate the average sewage flow per residential customer in such developments by measuring actual sewage flows over at least 12 consecutive months at the points where such developments connected to the authority's sewer main.


(iii) All data and other information considered or obtained by an authority in connection with determining capacity under this subsection shall be made available to the public upon request.


(iv) If any person required to pay a tapping fee submits to the authority an opinion from a professional engineer that challenges the validity of the results of the calculation of design capacity required to serve new residential customers prepared under subparagraph (i) or (ii), the authority shall within 30 days obtain a written certification from another professional engineer, who is not an employee of the authority, verifying that the results and the calculations, methodology and measurement were performed in accordance with this title   3 and generally accepted engineering practices.  If an authority does not obtain a certification required under this subsection within 30 days of receiving such challenge, the authority may not impose or collect tapping fees based on any such challenged calculations or study until such engineering certification is obtained.



(f) An authority may use lower design capacity requirements and impose lower tapping fees for multifamily residential dwellings than imposed on other types of residential customers.



(VI) Separate accounting for future facility costs.  Any portion of tapping fees collected which, based on facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future in accordance with this section, shall be separately accounted for and shall be expended only for that particular facility or a substitute facility accomplishing the same purpose which is commenced within the same period.  Such accounting shall include, but not be limited to, the total fees collected as a result of including facilities to be constructed in the future, the source of the fees collected and the amount of fees expended on specific facilities.  The proportionate share of tapping fees based upon facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future under this section shall be refunded to the payor of such fees within 90 days of the occurrence of the following:

(a) the authority abandons its plan or a part thereof to construct or acquire a facility or facilities which are the basis for such fee;  or


(b) the facilities have not been placed into service within seven years, or, for an authority which provides service to five or more municipalities, the facilities have not been placed into service within 20 years, after adoption of a resolution which imposes tapping fees which are based upon facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future.  Any refund of fees held for 20 years shall include interest for the period the money was held.



(VII) Definitions.  As used in this clause, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subclause:
“BOD5.” The five-day biochemical-oxygen demand.
“Design capacity.”  For residential customers, the permitted or rated capacity of facilities expressed in million gallons per day.  For nonresidential customers, design capacity may also be expressed in pounds of BOD5 per day, pounds of suspended solids per day or any other capacity-defining parameter that is separately and specifically set forth in the permit governing the operation of the system and based upon its original design as modified by those regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over these facilities.  Additionally, for separate fire service customers, the permitted or rated capacity of fire service facilities may be expressed in peak flows.  The units of measurement used to express design capacity shall be the same units of measurement used to express the system design capacity.  Except as otherwise provided for special purpose facilities, design capacity may not be expressed in terms of equivalent dwelling units.
“Outstanding debt.”  The principal amount outstanding of any bonds, notes, loans or other form of indebtedness used to finance or refinance facilities included in the tapping fee.
“Service line.”  A water or sewer line that directly connects a single building or structure to a distribution or collection facility.
“System design capacity.”  The design capacity of the system for which the tapping fee is being calculated which represents the total design capacity of the treatment facility or water sources.




(ii) Every authority charging a tapping, customer facilities or connection fee shall do so only pursuant to a resolution adopted at a public meeting of the authority.  The authority shall have available for public inspection a detailed itemization of all calculations, clearly showing the maximum fees allowable for each part of the tapping fee and the manner in which the fees were determined, which shall be made a part of any resolution imposing such fees.  A tapping, customer facilities or connection fee may be revised and imposed upon those who subsequently connect to the system, subject to the provisions and limitations of the act.


(iii) No authority shall have the power to impose a connection fee, customer facilities fee, tapping fee or similar fee except as provided specifically under this section.


(iv) A municipality or municipal authority with available excess sewage capacity, wishing to sell a portion of that capacity to another municipality or municipal authority, may not charge a higher cost for the capacity portion of the tapping fee as the selling entity charges to its customers for the capacity portion of the tapping fee.  In turn, the municipality or municipal authority buying this excess capacity may not charge a higher cost for the capacity portion of the tapping fee to its residential customers than that charged to them by the selling entity.


(v) As used in this paragraph, the term “residential customer” shall also include those developing property for residential dwellings that require multiple tapping fee permits.  This paragraph shall not be applicable to intermunicipal or interauthority agreements relative to the purchase of excess capacity by an authority or municipality in effect prior to February 20, 2001.



(i) The fees may include any of the following if they are separately set forth in a resolution adopted by the authority:

(A) Connection fee.  A connection fee shall not exceed an amount based upon the actual cost of the connection of the property extending from the authority's main to the property line or curb stop of the property connected.  The authority may also base the connection fee upon an average cost for previously installed connections of similar type and size.  Such average cost may be trended to current cost using published cost indexes.  In lieu of payment of the fee, an authority may require the construction of those facilities by the property owner who requested the connection.


(B) Customer facilities fee.  A customer facilities fee shall not exceed an amount based upon the actual cost of facilities serving the connected property from the property line or curb stop to the proposed dwelling or building to be served.  The fee shall be chargeable only if the authority installs the customer facilities.  In lieu of payment of the customer facilities fee, an authority may require the construction of those facilities by the property owner who requests customer facilities.  In the case of water service, the fee may include the cost of a water meter and installation if the authority provides or installs the water meter.  If the property connected or to be connected with the sewer system of the authority is not equipped with a water meter, the authority may install a meter at its own cost and expense.  If the property is supplied with water from the facilities of a public water supply agency, the authority shall not install a meter without the consent and approval of the public water supply agency.


(C) Tapping fee.  A tapping fee shall not exceed an amount based upon some or all of the following parts which shall be separately set forth in the resolution adopted by the authority to establish these fees.  In lieu of payment of this fee, an authority may require the construction and dedication of only such capacity, distribution-collection or special purpose facilities necessary to supply service to the property owner or owners.

(I) Capacity part.  The capacity part shall not exceed an amount that is based upon the cost of capacity-related facilities, including, but not limited to, source of supply, treatment, pumping, transmission, trunk, interceptor and outfall mains, storage, sludge treatment or disposal, interconnection or other general system facilities.  Except as specifically provided in this paragraph, such facilities may include only those that provide existing service.  The cost of capacity-related facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon their historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities.  To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of current replacement cost.  Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable.  Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers.  The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section.  For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities.  The capacity part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of said facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the total cost of the facilities as described herein divided by the system design capacity of all such facilities.  Where the cost of facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future are included in the calculation of the capacity part as permitted herein, the total cost of the facilities shall be divided by the system design capacity plus the additional capacity to be provided by the facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future.  An authority may allocate its capacity-related facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional capacity-related tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers.  The cost of facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future that will increase the system design capacity may be included in the calculation of the capacity part, subject to the provisions of clause (VI).  The cost of such facilities shall not exceed their reasonable estimated cost set forth in a duly adopted annual budget or a five-year capital improvement plan.  The authority shall have taken at least two of the following actions toward construction of the facilities:

(e) Except as otherwise provided for the calculation of a special purpose part, the design capacity required by a new residential customer used in calculating sewer or water tapping fees shall not exceed an amount established by multiplying 65 gallons per capita per day for water capacity, 90 gallons per capita per day for sewer capacity times the average number of persons per household as established by the most recent census data provided by the United States Census Bureau.  If an authority service area is entirely within a municipal boundary for which there is corresponding census data specifying the average number of persons per household, issued by the United States Census Bureau, the average shall be used.  If an authority service area is not entirely within a municipal boundary but is entirely within a county or other geographic area within Pennsylvania for which the United States Census Bureau has provided the average number of persons per household, then that average for the county or geographic area shall be used.  If an authority service area is not entirely within a municipal, county or other geographic area within Pennsylvania for which the United States Census Bureau has calculated an average number of persons per household, then the Pennsylvania average number of persons per household shall be used as published by the United States Census Bureau.  Alternatively, the design capacity required for a new residential customer shall be determined by a study but shall not exceed:

(i) for water capacity, the average residential water consumption per residential customer, or, for sewage capacity, the average residential water consumption per residential customer plus ten percent.  The average residential water consumption shall be determined by dividing the total water consumption for all metered residential customers in the authority's service area over at least a 12-consecutive-month period within the most recent five years by the average number of customers during the period;  or


(ii) for sewer capacity, the average sewage flow per residential customer determined by a measured sewage flow study.  Such study shall be completed in accordance with sound engineering practices within the most recent five years for the lesser of three or all residential subdivisions of more than ten lots which have collection systems in good repair and which connected to the authority's facilities within the most recent five years.  The study shall calculate the average sewage flow per residential customer in such developments by measuring actual sewage flows over at least 12 consecutive months at the points where such developments connected to the authority's sewer main.


(iii) All data and other information considered or obtained by an authority in connection with determining capacity under this subsection shall be made available to the public upon request.


(iv) If any person required to pay a tapping fee submits to the authority an opinion from a professional engineer that challenges the validity of the results of the calculation of design capacity required to serve new residential customers prepared under subparagraph (i) or (ii), the authority shall within 30 days obtain a written certification from another professional engineer, who is not an employee of the authority, verifying that the results and the calculations, methodology and measurement were performed in accordance with this title   3 and generally accepted engineering practices.  If an authority does not obtain a certification required under this subsection within 30 days of receiving such challenge, the authority may not impose or collect tapping fees based on any such challenged calculations or study until such engineering certification is obtained.



(f) An authority may use lower design capacity requirements and impose lower tapping fees for multifamily residential dwellings than imposed on other types of residential customers.



(VI) Separate accounting for future facility costs.  Any portion of tapping fees collected which, based on facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future in accordance with this section, shall be separately accounted for and shall be expended only for that particular facility or a substitute facility accomplishing the same purpose which is commenced within the same period.  Such accounting shall include, but not be limited to, the total fees collected as a result of including facilities to be constructed in the future, the source of the fees collected and the amount of fees expended on specific facilities.  The proportionate share of tapping fees based upon facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future under this section shall be refunded to the payor of such fees within 90 days of the occurrence of the following:

(a) the authority abandons its plan or a part thereof to construct or acquire a facility or facilities which are the basis for such fee;  or


(b) the facilities have not been placed into service within seven years, or, for an authority which provides service to five or more municipalities, the facilities have not been placed into service within 20 years, after adoption of a resolution which imposes tapping fees which are based upon facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future.  Any refund of fees held for 20 years shall include interest for the period the money was held.



(VII) Definitions.  As used in this clause, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings given to them in this subclause:
“BOD5.” The five-day biochemical-oxygen demand.
“Design capacity.”  For residential customers, the permitted or rated capacity of facilities expressed in million gallons per day.  For nonresidential customers, design capacity may also be expressed in pounds of BOD5 per day, pounds of suspended solids per day or any other capacity-defining parameter that is separately and specifically set forth in the permit governing the operation of the system and based upon its original design as modified by those regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over these facilities.  Additionally, for separate fire service customers, the permitted or rated capacity of fire service facilities may be expressed in peak flows.  The units of measurement used to express design capacity shall be the same units of measurement used to express the system design capacity.  Except as otherwise provided for special purpose facilities, design capacity may not be expressed in terms of equivalent dwelling units.
“Outstanding debt.”  The principal amount outstanding of any bonds, notes, loans or other form of indebtedness used to finance or refinance facilities included in the tapping fee.
“Service line.”  A water or sewer line that directly connects a single building or structure to a distribution or collection facility.
“System design capacity.”  The design capacity of the system for which the tapping fee is being calculated which represents the total design capacity of the treatment facility or water sources.




(A) Connection fee.  A connection fee shall not exceed an amount based upon the actual cost of the connection of the property extending from the authority's main to the property line or curb stop of the property connected.  The authority may also base the connection fee upon an average cost for previously installed connections of similar type and size.  Such average cost may be trended to current cost using published cost indexes.  In lieu of payment of the fee, an authority may require the construction of those facilities by the property owner who requested the connection.


(B) Customer facilities fee.  A customer facilities fee shall not exceed an amount based upon the actual cost of facilities serving the connected property from the property line or curb stop to the proposed dwelling or building to be served.  The fee shall be chargeable only if the authority installs the customer facilities.  In lieu of payment of the customer facilities fee, an authority may require the construction of those facilities by the property owner who requests customer facilities.  In the case of water service, the fee may include the cost of a water meter and installation if the authority provides or installs the water meter.  If the property connected or to be connected with the sewer system of the authority is not equipped with a water meter, the authority may install a meter at its own cost and expense.  If the property is supplied with water from the facilities of a public water supply agency, the authority shall not install a meter without the consent and approval of the public water supply agency.


(C) Tapping fee.  A tapping fee shall not exceed an amount based upon some or all of the following parts which shall be separately set forth in the resolution adopted by the authority to establish these fees.  In lieu of payment of this fee, an authority may require the construction and dedication of only such capacity, distribution-collection or special purpose facilities necessary to supply service to the property owner or owners.

(I) Capacity part.  The capacity part shall not exceed an amount that is based upon the cost of capacity-related facilities, including, but not limited to, source of supply, treatment, pumping, transmission, trunk, interceptor and outfall mains, storage, sludge treatment or disposal, interconnection or other general system facilities.  Except as specifically provided in this paragraph, such facilities may include only those that provide existing service.  The cost of capacity-related facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon their historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities.  To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of current replacement cost.  Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable.  Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers.  The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section.  For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities.  The capacity part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of said facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the total cost of the facilities as described herein divided by the system design capacity of all such facilities.  Where the cost of facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future are included in the calculation of the capacity part as permitted herein, the total cost of the facilities shall be divided by the system design capacity plus the additional capacity to be provided by the facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future.  An authority may allocate its capacity-related facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional capacity-related tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers.  The cost of facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future that will increase the system design capacity may be included in the calculation of the capacity part, subject to the provisions of clause (VI).  The cost of such facilities shall not exceed their reasonable estimated cost set forth in a duly adopted annual budget or a five-year capital improvement plan.  The authority shall have taken at least two of the following actions toward construction of the facilities:

(a) obtained financing for the facilities;


(b) entered into a contract obligating the authority to construct or pay for the cost of construction of the facilities or its portion thereof in the event that multiple parties are constructing the facilities;


(c) obtained a permit for the facilities;


(d) obtained title to or condemned additional real estate upon which the facilities will be constructed;


(e) entered into a contract obligating the authority to purchase or acquire facilities owned by another;


(f) prepared an engineering feasibility study specifically related to the facilities, which study recommends the construction of the facilities within a five-year period;  


(g) entered into a contract for the design or construction of the facilities or adopted a budget which includes the use of in-house resources for the design or construction of the facilities.



(II) Distribution or collection part.  The distribution or collection part may not exceed an amount based upon the cost of distribution or collection facilities required to provide service, such as mains, hydrants and pumping stations.  Facilities may only include those that provide existing service.  The cost of distribution or collections facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities.  To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of replacement cost.  Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable. Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers.  The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section.  For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities.  The distribution or collection part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of said facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the cost of the facilities divided by the design capacity.  An authority may allocate its distribution- related or collection-related facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional distribution-related or collection- related tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers.


(III) Special purpose part.  A part for special purpose facilities shall be applicable only to a particular group of customers or for serving a particular purpose or a specific area based upon the cost of the facilities, including, but not limited to, booster pump stations, fire service facilities, water or sewer mains, pumping stations and industrial wastewater treatment facilities.  Such facilities may include only those that provide existing service.  The cost of special purpose facilities, excluding facilities contributed to the authority by any person, government or agency, or portions of facilities paid for with contributions or grants other than tapping fees, shall be based upon historical cost trended to current cost using published cost indexes or upon the historical cost plus interest and other financing fees paid on debt financing such facilities.  To the extent that historical cost is not ascertainable, tapping fees may be based upon an engineer's reasonable written estimate of current replacement cost.  Such written estimate shall be based upon and include an itemized listing of those components of the actual facilities for which historical cost is not ascertainable.  Outstanding debt related to the facilities shall be subtracted from the cost except when calculating the initial tapping fee imposed for connection to facilities exclusively serving new customers.  The outstanding debt shall be subtracted for all subsequent revisions of the initial tapping fee where the historical cost has been updated to reflect current cost except as specifically provided in this section.  For tapping fees or components related to facilities initially serving exclusively new customers, an authority may, no more frequently than annually and without updating the historical cost of or subtracting the outstanding debt related to such facilities, increase such tapping fee by an amount calculated by multiplying the tapping fee by the weighted average interest rate on the debt related to such facilities applicable for the period since the fee was initially established or the last increase of the tapping fee for such facilities.  The special purpose part of the tapping fee per unit of design capacity of such special purpose facilities required by the new customer shall not exceed the cost of the facilities as described herein divided by the design capacity of the facilities.  Where an authority constructs special purpose facilities at its own expense, the design capacity for the facilities may be expressed in terms of the number of equivalent dwelling units to be served by the facilities.  In no event shall an authority continue to collect any tapping fee which includes a special purpose part after special purpose part fees have been imposed on the total number of design capacity units used in the original calculation of the special purpose part.  An authority may allocate its special purpose facilities to different sections or districts of its system and may impose additional special purpose tapping fees on specific groups of existing customers such as commercial and industrial customers in conjunction with additional capacity requirements of those customers.


(IV) Reimbursement part.  The reimbursement part shall only be applicable to the users of certain specific facilities when a fee required to be collected from such users will be reimbursed to the person at whose expense the facilities were constructed as set forth in a written agreement between the authority and such person at whose expense such facilities were constructed.


(V) Calculation of tapping fee.

(a) In arriving at the cost to be included in the tapping fee, the same cost shall not be included in more than one part of the tapping fee.


(b) No tapping fee may be based upon or include the cost of expanding, replacing, updating or upgrading facilities serving only existing customers in order to meet stricter efficiency, environmental, regulatory or safety standards or to provide better service to or meet the needs of existing customers.


(c) The cost used in calculating tapping fees shall not include maintenance and operation expenses.


(d) As used in this subclause, “maintenance and operation expenses” are those expenditures made during the useful life of a sewer or water system for labor, materials, utilities, equipment accessories, appurtenances and other items which are necessary to manage and maintain the system capacity and performance and to provide the service for which the system was constructed. Costs or expenses to reduce or eliminate groundwater infiltration or inflow may not be included in the cost of facilities used to calculate tapping fees unless these costs or expenses result in an increase in system design capacity.


(e) Except as otherwise provided for the calculation of a special purpose part, the design capacity required by a new residential customer used in calculating sewer or water tapping fees shall not exceed an amount established by multiplying 65 gallons per capita per day for water capacity, 90 gallons per capita per day for sewer capacity times the average number of persons per household as established by the most recent census data provided by the United States Census Bureau.  If an authority service area is entirely within a municipal boundary for which there is corresponding census data specifying the average number of persons per household, issued by the United States Census Bureau, the average shall be used.  If an authority service area is not entirely within a municipal boundary but is entirely within a county or other geographic area within Pennsylvania for which the United States Census Bureau has provided the average number of persons per household, then that average for the county or geographic area shall be used.  If an authority service area is not entirely within a municipal, county or other geographic area within Pennsylvania for which the United States Census Bureau has calculated an average number of persons per household, then the Pennsylvania average number of persons per household shall be used as published by the United States Census Bureau.  Alternatively, the design capacity required for a new residential customer shall be determined by a study but shall not exceed:

(i) for water capacity, the average residential water consumption per residential customer, or, for sewage capacity, the average residential water consumption per residential customer plus ten percent.  The average residential water consumption shall be determined by dividing the total water consumption for all metered residential customers in the authority's service area over at least a 12-consecutive-month period within the most recent five years by the average number of customers during the period;  or


(ii) for sewer capacity, the average sewage flow per residential customer determined by a measured sewage flow study.  Such study shall be completed in accordance with sound engineering practices within the most recent five years for the lesser of three or all residential subdivisions of more than ten lots which have collection systems in good repair and which connected to the authority's facilities within the most recent five years.  The study shall calculate the average sewage flow per residential customer in such developments by measuring actual sewage flows over at least 12 consecutive months at the points where such developments connected to the authority's sewer main.


(iii) All data and other information considered or obtained by an authority in connection with determining capacity under this subsection shall be made available to the public upon request.


(iv) If any person required to pay a tapping fee submits to the authority an opinion from a professional engineer that challenges the validity of the results of the calculation of design capacity required to serve new residential customers prepared under subparagraph (i) or (ii), the authority shall within 30 days obtain a written certification from another professional engineer, who is not an employee of the authority, verifying that the results and the calculations, methodology and measurement were performed in accordance with this title   3 and generally accepted engineering practices.  If an authority does not obtain a certification required under this subsection within 30 days of receiving such challenge, the authority may not impose or collect tapping fees based on any such challenged calculations or study until such engineering certification is obtained.



(f) An authority may use lower design capacity requirements and impose lower tapping fees for multifamily residential dwellings than imposed on other types of residential customers.



(VI) Separate accounting for future facility costs.  Any portion of tapping fees collected which, based on facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future in accordance with this section, shall be separately accounted for and shall be expended only for that particular facility or a substitute facility accomplishing the same purpose which is commenced within the same period.  Such accounting shall include, but not be limited to, the total fees collected as a result of including facilities to be constructed in the future, the source of the fees collected and the amount of fees expended on specific facilities.  The proportionate share of tapping fees based upon facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future under this section shall be refunded to the payor of such fees within 90 days of the occurrence of the following:

(a) the authority abandons its plan or a part thereof to construct or acquire a facility or facilities which are the basis for such fee;  or


(b) the facilities have not been placed into service within seven years, or, for an authority which provides service to five or more municipalities, the facilities have not been placed into service within 20 years, after adoption of a resolution which imposes tapping fees which are based upon facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future.  Any refund of fees held for 20 years shall include interest for the period the money was held.

(f) An authority may use lower design capacity requirements and impose lower tapping fees for multifamily residential dwellings than imposed on other types of residential customers.



(a) In arriving at the cost to be included in the tapping fee, the same cost shall not be included in more than one part of the tapping fee.


(b) No tapping fee may be based upon or include the cost of expanding, replacing, updating or upgrading facilities serving only existing customers in order to meet stricter efficiency, environmental, regulatory or safety standards or to provide better service to or meet the needs of existing customers.


(c) The cost used in calculating tapping fees shall not include maintenance and operation expenses.


(d) As used in this subclause, “maintenance and operation expenses” are those expenditures made during the useful life of a sewer or water system for labor, materials, utilities, equipment accessories, appurtenances and other items which are necessary to manage and maintain the system capacity and performance and to provide the service for which the system was constructed. Costs or expenses to reduce or eliminate groundwater infiltration or inflow may not be included in the cost of facilities used to calculate tapping fees unless these costs or expenses result in an increase in system design capacity.


(e) Except as otherwise provided for the calculation of a special purpose part, the design capacity required by a new residential customer used in calculating sewer or water tapping fees shall not exceed an amount established by multiplying 65 gallons per capita per day for water capacity, 90 gallons per capita per day for sewer capacity times the average number of persons per household as established by the most recent census data provided by the United States Census Bureau.  If an authority service area is entirely within a municipal boundary for which there is corresponding census data specifying the average number of persons per household, issued by the United States Census Bureau, the average shall be used.  If an authority service area is not entirely within a municipal boundary but is entirely within a county or other geographic area within Pennsylvania for which the United States Census Bureau has provided the average number of persons per household, then that average for the county or geographic area shall be used.  If an authority service area is not entirely within a municipal, county or other geographic area within Pennsylvania for which the United States Census Bureau has calculated an average number of persons per household, then the Pennsylvania average number of persons per household shall be used as published by the United States Census Bureau.  Alternatively, the design capacity required for a new residential customer shall be determined by a study but shall not exceed:

(i) for water capacity, the average residential water consumption per residential customer, or, for sewage capacity, the average residential water consumption per residential customer plus ten percent.  The average residential water consumption shall be determined by dividing the total water consumption for all metered residential customers in the authority's service area over at least a 12-consecutive-month period within the most recent five years by the average number of customers during the period;  or


(ii) for sewer capacity, the average sewage flow per residential customer determined by a measured sewage flow study.  Such study shall be completed in accordance with sound engineering practices within the most recent five years for the lesser of three or all residential subdivisions of more than ten lots which have collection systems in good repair and which connected to the authority's facilities within the most recent five years.  The study shall calculate the average sewage flow per residential customer in such developments by measuring actual sewage flows over at least 12 consecutive months at the points where such developments connected to the authority's sewer main.


(iii) All data and other information considered or obtained by an authority in connection with determining capacity under this subsection shall be made available to the public upon request.


(iv) If any person required to pay a tapping fee submits to the authority an opinion from a professional engineer that challenges the validity of the results of the calculation of design capacity required to serve new residential customers prepared under subparagraph (i) or (ii), the authority shall within 30 days obtain a written certification from another professional engineer, who is not an employee of the authority, verifying that the results and the calculations, methodology and measurement were performed in accordance with this title   3 and generally accepted engineering practices.  If an authority does not obtain a certification required under this subsection within 30 days of receiving such challenge, the authority may not impose or collect tapping fees based on any such challenged calculations or study until such engineering certification is obtained.

(iii) All data and other information considered or obtained by an authority in connection with determining capacity under this subsection shall be made available to the public upon request.


(iv) If any person required to pay a tapping fee submits to the authority an opinion from a professional engineer that challenges the validity of the results of the calculation of design capacity required to serve new residential customers prepared under subparagraph (i) or (ii), the authority shall within 30 days obtain a written certification from another professional engineer, who is not an employee of the authority, verifying that the results and the calculations, methodology and measurement were performed in accordance with this title   3 and generally accepted engineering practices.  If an authority does not obtain a certification required under this subsection within 30 days of receiving such challenge, the authority may not impose or collect tapping fees based on any such challenged calculations or study until such engineering certification is obtained.


(f) An authority may use lower design capacity requirements and impose lower tapping fees for multifamily residential dwellings than imposed on other types of residential customers.


(VI) Separate accounting for future facility costs.  Any portion of tapping fees collected which, based on facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future in accordance with this section, shall be separately accounted for and shall be expended only for that particular facility or a substitute facility accomplishing the same purpose which is commenced within the same period.  Such accounting shall include, but not be limited to, the total fees collected as a result of including facilities to be constructed in the future, the source of the fees collected and the amount of fees expended on specific facilities.  The proportionate share of tapping fees based upon facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future under this section shall be refunded to the payor of such fees within 90 days of the occurrence of the following:

(a) the authority abandons its plan or a part thereof to construct or acquire a facility or facilities which are the basis for such fee;  or


(b) the facilities have not been placed into service within seven years, or, for an authority which provides service to five or more municipalities, the facilities have not been placed into service within 20 years, after adoption of a resolution which imposes tapping fees which are based upon facilities to be constructed or acquired in the future.  Any refund of fees held for 20 years shall include interest for the period the money was held.

(a) General.--Where a site-specific standard is selected as the environmental remediation standard or where the background or Statewide health standard is selected but not achieved, remedial investigation, risk assessment, cleanup plans and final reports shall be developed using the procedures and factors established by this section.


(b) Carcinogens.--For known or suspected carcinogens, soil and groundwater cleanup standards shall be established at exposures which represent an excess upper-bound lifetime risk of between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 1,000,000.  The cumulative excess risk to exposed populations, including sensitive subgroups, shall not be greater than 1 in 10,000.


(c) Systemic toxicants.--For systemic toxicants, soil and groundwater cleanup standards shall represent levels to which the human population could be exposed on a daily basis without appreciable risk of deleterious effect to the exposed population.  Where several systemic toxicants affect the same target organ or act by the same method of toxicity, the hazard index shall not exceed one.  The hazard index is the sum of the hazard quotients for multiple systemic toxicants acting through a single-medium exposure pathway or through multiple-media exposure pathways.


(d) Groundwater.--Cleanup standards for groundwater shall be established in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) using the following considerations:

(1) For groundwater in aquifers, site-specific standards shall be established using the following procedures:

(i) The current and probable future use of groundwater shall be identified and protected.  Groundwater that has a background total dissolved solids content greater than 2,500 milligrams per liter or is not capable of transmitting water to a pumping well in usable and sustainable quantities shall not be considered a current or potential source of drinking water.


(ii) Site-specific sources of contaminants and potential receptors shall be identified.


(iii) Natural environmental conditions affecting the fate and transport of contaminants, such as natural attenuation, shall be determined by appropriate scientific methods.



(2) Groundwater not in aquifers shall be evaluated using current or probable future exposure scenarios.  Appropriate management actions shall be instituted at the point of exposure where a person is exposed to groundwater by ingestion or other avenues to protect human health and the environment.  This shall not preclude taking appropriate source management actions by the responsible party to achieve the equivalent level of protection.



(1) For groundwater in aquifers, site-specific standards shall be established using the following procedures:

(i) The current and probable future use of groundwater shall be identified and protected.  Groundwater that has a background total dissolved solids content greater than 2,500 milligrams per liter or is not capable of transmitting water to a pumping well in usable and sustainable quantities shall not be considered a current or potential source of drinking water.


(ii) Site-specific sources of contaminants and potential receptors shall be identified.


(iii) Natural environmental conditions affecting the fate and transport of contaminants, such as natural attenuation, shall be determined by appropriate scientific methods.



(i) The current and probable future use of groundwater shall be identified and protected.  Groundwater that has a background total dissolved solids content greater than 2,500 milligrams per liter or is not capable of transmitting water to a pumping well in usable and sustainable quantities shall not be considered a current or potential source of drinking water.


(ii) Site-specific sources of contaminants and potential receptors shall be identified.


(iii) Natural environmental conditions affecting the fate and transport of contaminants, such as natural attenuation, shall be determined by appropriate scientific methods.


(2) Groundwater not in aquifers shall be evaluated using current or probable future exposure scenarios.  Appropriate management actions shall be instituted at the point of exposure where a person is exposed to groundwater by ingestion or other avenues to protect human health and the environment.  This shall not preclude taking appropriate source management actions by the responsible party to achieve the equivalent level of protection.


(e) Soil.--Concentrations of regulated substances in soil shall not exceed values calculated in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) based on human ingestion of soil where direct contact exposure to the soil may reasonably occur;  values calculated to protect groundwater in aquifers at levels determined in accordance with subsections (b), (c) and (d);  and values calculated to satisfy the requirements of subsection (g) with respect to discharges or releases to surface water or emissions to the outdoor air.  Such determinations shall take into account the effects of institutional and engineering controls, if any, and shall be based on sound scientific principles, including fate and transport analysis of the migration of a regulated substance in relation to receptor exposures.


(f) Factors.--In determining soil and groundwater cleanup standards under subsections (d) and (e), the following factors shall also be considered:

(b) Consistent with 
section 2301
,   1 the Department of Public Welfare shall:

53 Pa.C.S. § 8426

Pennsylvania Statutes Title 35 P.S. Health and Safety § 6026.303.303. Statewide health standard,https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-35-ps-health-and-safety/pa-st-sect-35-6026-303.html,"
(a) Standard.--The Environmental Quality Board shall promulgate Statewide health standards for regulated substances for each environmental medium.  The standards shall include any existing numerical residential and nonresidential health-based standards adopted by the department and by the Federal Government by regulation or statute, and health advisory levels.  For those health-based standards not already established by regulation or statute, the Environmental Quality Board shall by regulation propose residential and nonresidential standards as medium-specific concentrations within 12 months of the effective date of this act.  The Environmental Quality Board shall also promulgate along with the standards the methods used to calculate the standards.  Standards adopted under this section shall be no more stringent than those standards adopted by the Federal Government.


(b) Medium-specific concentrations.--The following requirements shall be used to establish a medium-specific concentration:

(1) Any regulated discharge into surface water occurring during or after attainment of the Statewide health standard shall comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to surface water discharges.


(2) Any regulated emissions to the outdoor air occurring during or after attainment of the Statewide health standard shall comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to emissions into the outdoor air.


(3) The concentration of a regulated substance in groundwater in aquifers used or currently planned to be used for drinking water or for agricultural purposes shall comply with the maximum contaminant level or health advisory level established for drinking water.  If the groundwater at the site has naturally occurring background total dissolved solids concentrations greater than 2,500 milligrams per liter, the remediation standard for a regulated substance dissolved in the groundwater may be adjusted by multiplying the medium-specific concentration for groundwater in aquifers by 100.  The resulting value becomes the maximum contaminant level for groundwater.


(4) For the residential standard, the concentration of a regulated substance in soil shall not exceed either the direct contact soil medium-specific concentration based on residential exposure factors within a depth of up to 15 feet from the existing ground surface or the soil-to-groundwater pathway numeric value throughout the soil column, the latter to be determined by any one of the following methods:

(i) A value which is 100 times the medium-specific concentration for groundwater.


(ii) A concentration in soil at the site that does not produce a leachate in excess of the medium-specific concentrations for groundwater in the aquifer when subjected to the Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedures, Method 1312 of SW 846, Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.


(iii) A generic value determined not to produce a concentration in groundwater in the aquifer in excess of the medium-specific concentration for groundwater based on a valid, peer-reviewed scientific method which properly accounts for factors affecting the fate, transport and attenuation of the regulated substance throughout the soil column.



(5) For the nonresidential standard, the concentration of a regulated substance in soil shall not exceed either the direct contact soil medium-specific concentration based on nonresidential exposure factors within a depth of up to 15 feet from the existing ground surface using valid scientific methods reflecting worker exposure or the soil-to-groundwater pathway numeric value determined in accordance with paragraph (4).


(6) Exposure scenarios for medium-specific concentrations for nonresidential conditions shall be established using valid scientific methods reflecting worker exposure.



(1) Any regulated discharge into surface water occurring during or after attainment of the Statewide health standard shall comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to surface water discharges.


(2) Any regulated emissions to the outdoor air occurring during or after attainment of the Statewide health standard shall comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to emissions into the outdoor air.


(3) The concentration of a regulated substance in groundwater in aquifers used or currently planned to be used for drinking water or for agricultural purposes shall comply with the maximum contaminant level or health advisory level established for drinking water.  If the groundwater at the site has naturally occurring background total dissolved solids concentrations greater than 2,500 milligrams per liter, the remediation standard for a regulated substance dissolved in the groundwater may be adjusted by multiplying the medium-specific concentration for groundwater in aquifers by 100.  The resulting value becomes the maximum contaminant level for groundwater.


(4) For the residential standard, the concentration of a regulated substance in soil shall not exceed either the direct contact soil medium-specific concentration based on residential exposure factors within a depth of up to 15 feet from the existing ground surface or the soil-to-groundwater pathway numeric value throughout the soil column, the latter to be determined by any one of the following methods:

(i) A value which is 100 times the medium-specific concentration for groundwater.


(ii) A concentration in soil at the site that does not produce a leachate in excess of the medium-specific concentrations for groundwater in the aquifer when subjected to the Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedures, Method 1312 of SW 846, Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.


(iii) A generic value determined not to produce a concentration in groundwater in the aquifer in excess of the medium-specific concentration for groundwater based on a valid, peer-reviewed scientific method which properly accounts for factors affecting the fate, transport and attenuation of the regulated substance throughout the soil column.



(i) A value which is 100 times the medium-specific concentration for groundwater.


(ii) A concentration in soil at the site that does not produce a leachate in excess of the medium-specific concentrations for groundwater in the aquifer when subjected to the Synthetic Precipitation Leaching Procedures, Method 1312 of SW 846, Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.


(iii) A generic value determined not to produce a concentration in groundwater in the aquifer in excess of the medium-specific concentration for groundwater based on a valid, peer-reviewed scientific method which properly accounts for factors affecting the fate, transport and attenuation of the regulated substance throughout the soil column.


(5) For the nonresidential standard, the concentration of a regulated substance in soil shall not exceed either the direct contact soil medium-specific concentration based on nonresidential exposure factors within a depth of up to 15 feet from the existing ground surface using valid scientific methods reflecting worker exposure or the soil-to-groundwater pathway numeric value determined in accordance with paragraph (4).


(6) Exposure scenarios for medium-specific concentrations for nonresidential conditions shall be established using valid scientific methods reflecting worker exposure.


(c) Additional factors.--When establishing a medium-specific concentration, other than those established under subsection (b)(1), (2) or (3), the medium-specific concentration for the ingestion of groundwater, inhalation of soils, ingestion and inhalation of volatiles and particulates shall be calculated by the department using valid scientific methods, reasonable exposure pathway assumptions and exposure factors for residential and nonresidential land use which are no more stringent than the standard default exposure factors established by EPA based on the following levels of risk:

(1) For a regulated substance which is a carcinogen, the medium-specific concentration is the concentration which represents an excess upper bound lifetime cancer target risk of between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 1,000,000.


(2) For a regulated substance which is a systemic toxicant, the medium-specific concentration is the concentration to which human populations could be exposed by direct ingestion or inhalation on a daily basis without appreciable risk of deleterious effects for the exposed population.



(1) For a regulated substance which is a carcinogen, the medium-specific concentration is the concentration which represents an excess upper bound lifetime cancer target risk of between 1 in 10,000 and 1 in 1,000,000.


(2) For a regulated substance which is a systemic toxicant, the medium-specific concentration is the concentration to which human populations could be exposed by direct ingestion or inhalation on a daily basis without appreciable risk of deleterious effects for the exposed population.


(d) Relationship to background.--The concentration of a regulated substance in an environmental medium of concern on a site where the Statewide health standard has been selected shall not be required to meet the Statewide health standard if the Statewide health standard is numerically less than the background standard.  In such cases, the background standard shall apply.


(e) Attainment.--Final certification that a site or portion of a site meets the Statewide health standard shall be documented in the following manner:

(1) Attainment of cleanup levels shall be demonstrated by collection and analysis of representative samples from the environmental medium of concern, including soils, and groundwater in aquifers at the point of compliance through the application of statistical tests set forth in regulation or, if no regulations have been adopted, in a demonstration of a mathematically valid application of statistical tests.  The Department of Environmental Resources shall also recognize those methods of attainment demonstration generally recognized as appropriate for that particular remediation.


(2) A final report that documents attainment of the Statewide health standard shall be submitted to the department which includes the descriptions of procedures and conclusions of the site investigation to characterize the nature, extent, direction, rate of movement of the site and cumulative effects, if any, volume, composition and concentration of contaminants in environmental media, the basis for selecting environmental media of concern, documentation supporting the selection of residential or nonresidential exposure factors, descriptions of removal or treatment procedures performed in remediation, summaries of sampling methodology and analytical results which demonstrate that contaminants have been removed or treated to applicable levels and documentation of compliance with postremediation care requirements if they are needed to maintain the Statewide health standard.


(3) Institutional controls such as fencing and future land use restrictions on a site may not be used to attain the Statewide health standard.  Institutional controls may be used to maintain the Statewide health standard after remediation occurs.

Pennsylvania Statutes Title 35 P.S. Health and Safety § 1680.102.102. Findings and declaration of policy,https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-35-ps-health-and-safety/pa-st-sect-35-1680-102.html,"
(1) The welfare of the Commonwealth is threatened by the fact that throughout Pennsylvania the supply of private homes and rental units for persons and families of low and moderate income is inadequate to meet the need for such housing created by an expanding population, the wearing out of older dwellings and the elimination of substandard dwellings by governmental action, and by a shortage of suitable dwellings for elderly persons.


(2) Because of higher construction costs, a scarcity of financing available for housing and the resulting increase in interest rates, the housing need which exists in fact has not been able to find economic expression in a market demand sufficient to encourage greater production of homes and rental housing by private industry for persons and families of low and moderate income, including the elderly.


(3) Persons and families whose residences are condemned by governmental action in the prosecution of necessary public works in urban slum clearance programs and under regulatory laws protecting health and safety, face insuperable difficulties in finding new housing which is adequate, safe and sanitary.  Many such persons and families are not eligible to occupy public housing administered by governmental agencies and are also unable to rent or purchase adequate, safe and sanitary housing because of the economic conditions described.  Unless it becomes economically feasible for these persons and families to acquire housing in place of the dwellings now being eliminated by urban renewal programs in blighted areas and other dwellings removed by reason of other public works, such necessary governmental activities face serious curtailment or interruption.


(4) The Commonwealth has a strong moral responsibility to assist in providing opportunity for the rental or purchase of relocation housing by persons and families who are displaced by necessary governmental action, as well as a general and continuing responsibility to eliminate conditions which prevent private industry from supplying housing to relieve the general shortage of housing.


(5) Private industry alone has been and now is unable to provide the financing necessary, at a cost which persons and families of low and moderate income can afford, for housing for such persons and families and therefore, the specialized financing provided for in this act will encourage greater expenditure of private capital for housing.


(6) The relationship of a sufficient provision of adequate, safe and sanitary housing to the advancement of the public health and morals and to the prevention of fire, accident and crime is clear.


(7) Therefore, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to promote the health, safety and welfare of its inhabitants by the creation of a body corporate and politic, to be known as the “Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency,” which shall exist and operate for the purposes of alleviating the hardship which results from insufficient production of private homes and of rental housing for persons and families of low and moderate income, including the elderly, the hardship resulting from the relocation of persons displaced by governmental action, the deleterious effect of inadequate housing upon the general welfare of the Commonwealth, and the disadvantages, resulting from economic conditions, which bar private industry from satisfying a vital need, by broadening the market for private homes and for housing for persons and families of low and moderate income, including the elderly, through the provision of specialized financing secured by mortgages to corporations, individuals, joint ventures, partnerships, limited partnerships, trusts, cooperatives and condominiums, which are unable to obtain such financing in the general market or who are unable to participate in specialized Federal housing programs because of lack of available Federal funds, and through cooperation with and assistance to the Pennsylvania Department of Community Affairs   1 as such department carries into effect the powers and duties vested in it, thus improving and stimulating the distribution of investment capital for housing and neighborhood revitalization projects.  Such purposes are public purposes for which public money may be spent.

No part of the proposed roads of said system shall be an easement upon private property or in any manner interfere with the use thereof until established as a public road by the action of the court of quarter sessions.

(c) Plan of System to Be Followed;  Variations.  After such plans have been adopted and recorded pursuant to law, all applications under the preceding subsection shall be restricted and shall relate only to the establishing, opening, construction and improvement of the proposed roads of said system or parts thereof and the vacation of roads supplied by the portion opened and improved.  The commissioners may relocate, straighten, widen, extend, alter and open, construct and improve the proposed roads as laid out, surveyed, marked and shown upon the plans of said system, or to originally locate, lay out and establish, construct and improve roads which substantially supply said system or parts thereof which, although not parts of said system, are deemed by the said court to be main thoroughfares of sufficient importance to be improved by the county and to be added to said plan, and in such case to vacate so much of the roads of said system and of roads already established as may be rendered unnecessary by the changes or by an entirely new location.


(d) Improvement of Roads Not Part of System on Contribution From Parties Interested.  The commissioners may also originally locate, lay out and establish in whole or in part, relocate, straighten, widen, extend, alter and open, construct and improve roads not parts of said system nor deemed main thoroughfares, upon parties interested therein paying or securing to be paid, such proportion of the cost of the original construction and improvement as the commissioners may deem just, which shall not be less than one-fourth of such cost in any case.


(e) Annual Tax.  The commissioners may levy, assess and collect an annual tax, of not more than two mills upon the dollar, upon all real and personal property within the county taxable for county purposes, for the purpose of acquiring and securing a fund from which to pay all costs, damages and expenses required in locating, opening, widening, straightening, extending, building, improving, maintaining, repairing or vacating of the roads or parts thereof improved under the provisions of this section, and for the taking and using of such land as may be made necessary in constructing and maintaining proper slopes, embankments, fills and culverts.  The moneys so raised shall not be expended for any other purposes than those named in this subsection.  All warrants for the payment of any portion of the money raised for the purposes aforesaid shall be issued, in the manner provided by this act, upon estimates which shall be made from time to time by the person charged with such duty, and the amount and time within which the same shall be paid shall be fixed and determined in the contract made for the public work herein authorized.

(1) For projects in counties whose unemployment rate exceeds the Statewide unemployment rate by 40% or more, 1% for the first five years and 25% of the bond issue rate for the remainder of the loan.


(2) For projects in counties whose unemployment rate exceeds the Statewide unemployment rate, but exceeds it by less than 40%, 30% of the bond issue rate for the first five years and 60% of the bond issue rate for the remainder of the loan.


(3) For all other projects, 60% of the bond issue rate for the first five years and 75% of the bond issue rate for the remainder of the loan.


(4) For projects located within municipalities for which unemployment rates exist which would qualify the project for lower interest rates than if the relevant county unemployment rate were used, the unemployment rate of that municipality may be used in determining the interest rate on the loan.

For purposes of this subsection, the phrase “unemployment rate of the county” shall mean the average unemployment rate for the county in the most recent calendar year for which data has been finalized.  For the projects which serve multiple counties, the highest unemployment rate of the counties involved shall be used.  The unemployment data utilized shall be data reported by the Department of Labor and Industry.  For purposes of this subsection, the phrase “bond interest rate” shall be the rate of interest paid by the Commonwealth immediately preceding the date of the loan for the bonds issued under sections 16 and 17.  4

(g) Limitation on annual assistance.--The amount of assistance approved by the board under subsection (e) shall not in any fiscal year exceed the amount of interest earnings, State appropriations and any funds received specifically for grants which are deposited into the accounts of the authority.  This limitation shall not apply to projects funded prior to January 1, 1989, but the total amount of assistance under subsection (e) prior to January 1, 1989, shall not exceed $15,000,000, excluding moneys specifically appropriated by the General Assembly for grants.

(j) Continuing education of operators.--No agreement with individuals or entities shall be valid in the absence of an agreement by the individuals or entities seeking assistance under this act to assure that the system operators are participating or will participate in continuing education programs developed by the department.  If the board determines that the system operator of a system receiving assistance is not participating in continuing education programs, the board shall take all steps necessary to cease all financial assistance and recover all prior payments, including, but not limited to, the immediate repayment of any outstanding loans and interest and any grants.  The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to cases where financial assistance is provided for storm water projects.

Pennsylvania Statutes Title 24 P.S. Education § 2401.1. Form and contents of agreement,https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-24-ps-education/pa-st-sect-24-2401-1.html,"ARTICLE I. PURPOSE, FINDINGS, AND POLICY
1. The States party to this Agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession.  It is the purpose of this Agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the States party to it, and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.

2. The party States find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations.  Variations from State to State in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other States.  As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems.  Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their States of origin, can increase the available educational resources.  Participation in this Compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.

1. No compensation shall be paid when the disability or death is caused by the employe's violation of law, but the burden of proof of such fact shall be upon the employer.


2. The maximum compensation payable under this article for disability, and death resulting from silicosis, anthraco-silicosis, coal worker's pneumoconiosis, or asbestosis shall not exceed the sum of twelve thousand seven hundred fifty dollars ($12,750) which shall be full and complete payment for all disability, present or future, or for death from such occupational diseases arising out of employment by any and all employers in this Commonwealth except that any employe who has received the maximum compensation herein or heretofore payable shall be paid additional compensation in the amount of seventy-five dollars ($75) per month for each month of total disability occurring subsequent to the month in which such maximum compensation was received:  Provided, That in the case of any employe who received the maximum compensation herein or heretofore payable prior to the effective date of this amending act, such additional compensation shall commence only with the month this amending act becomes effective.  Such additional compensation which is paid to an employe who, on the effective date of this amending act, is receiving compensation or has theretofore received the maximum compensation prescribed, shall be paid by the Commonwealth.  Such additional compensation paid to an employe who first becomes entitled to compensation subsequent to the effective date of this amending act and who exhausts the maximum compensation prescribed, shall be paid from the same source or sources and in the same manner as the prescribed maximum compensation was paid.

2. The maximum compensation payable under this article for disability, and death resulting from silicosis, anthraco-silicosis, coal worker's pneumoconiosis, or asbestosis shall not exceed the sum of twelve thousand seven hundred fifty dollars ($12,750) which shall be full and complete payment for all disability, present or future, or for death from such occupational diseases arising out of employment by any and all employers in this Commonwealth except that any employe who has received the maximum compensation herein or heretofore payable shall be paid additional compensation in the amount of seventy-five dollars ($75) per month for each month of total disability occurring subsequent to the month in which such maximum compensation was received:  Provided, That in the case of any employe who received the maximum compensation herein or heretofore payable prior to the effective date of this amending act, such additional compensation shall commence only with the month this amending act becomes effective.  Such additional compensation which is paid to an employe who, on the effective date of this amending act, is receiving compensation or has theretofore received the maximum compensation prescribed, shall be paid by the Commonwealth.  Such additional compensation paid to an employe who first becomes entitled to compensation subsequent to the effective date of this amending act and who exhausts the maximum compensation prescribed, shall be paid from the same source or sources and in the same manner as the prescribed maximum compensation was paid.


(b) The right to receive compensation under this act shall not be affected by the fact that a minor is employed or is permitted to be employed in violation of the laws of this Commonwealth relating to the employment of minors, or that he obtained his employment by misrepresenting his age.


(c) Compensation for the occupational diseases enumerated in this act shall be paid only when such occupational disease   3 is peculiar to the occupation or industry in which the employe was engaged and not common to the general population.  Wherever compensable disability or death is mentioned as a cause for compensation under this act, it shall mean only compensable disability or death resulting from occupational disease and occurring within four years after the date of his last employment in such occupation or industry.

(g) The employer liable for the compensation provided by this article shall be the employer in whose employment the employe was last exposed to the hazard of the occupational disease claimed, regardless of the length of time of such last exposure:  Provided, That when a claimant alleges that disability or death was due to silicosis, anthraco-silicosis, coal worker's pneumoconiosis, asbestosis or any other occupational disease which developed to the point of disablement only after an exposure of five or more years, the only employer liable shall be the last employer in whose employment the employe was last exposed to the hazard of such occupational disease during a period of six months or more:  And provided further, That in those cases where disability or death is not conclusively proven to be the result of such last exposure, all compensation shall be paid by the Commonwealth.  An exposure during a period of less than six months after the effective date of this act shall not be deemed an exposure.  The notice of disability or death and claim shall be made to the employer who is liable under this subsection, his insurance carrier, if any, and the Commonwealth.


(h) Except as hereinafter provided, all compensation payable under this article shall be payable in periodic installments, as the wages of the employe were payable before the accident.

An application for compensation under this subsection shall not be accepted from any person who, during the preceding six months has been determined to be ineligible hereunder.
Every application shall be accompanied by two prints of the same recent photograph of the applicant, and such other proof of identity as the board shall require.  One of the prints shall be stamped by the board and returned to the applicant, who shall deliver it to the physician at the time of examination.  The physician shall attach the print to his report to the board.

Compact enacted,https://codes.findlaw.com/pa/title-35-pacsa-health-and-safety/pa-csa-sect-35-7601.html,"Article I. Purpose and AuthoritiesThis compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states.  For the purposes of this compact, the term “states” is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and all U.S. territorial possessions.The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency or enemy attack.This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods.  Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' National Guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between states.
Article II. General ImplementationEach party state entering into this compact recognizes that many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact.  Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency.  This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.The prompt, full and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the Federal Government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.
Article III. Party State Responsibilities
A. It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article.  In formulating such plans and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall:

2. review party states' individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency;


3. develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans;


4. assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries;


5. protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services and resources, both human and material;


6. inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness;  and


7. provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes or ordinances that restrict the implementation of the above responsibilities.


B. The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance to another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state.  The provisions of this compact shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives.  Requests may be verbal or in writing.  If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty days of the verbal request.  Requests shall provide the following information:

1. a description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, including, but not limited to, fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building, inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue;


2. the amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed;  and


3. the specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location.


C. There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States Government, with free exchange of information, plans and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.

Article IV. LimitationsAny party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof;  provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state.Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers, except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state, duties, rights and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services.  Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance.  These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving state, whichever is longer.
Article V. Licenses and PermitsWhenever any person holds a license, certificate or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical or other skills and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise.
Article VI. LiabilityOfficers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes.  No party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith.  Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence or recklessness.
Article VII. Supplementary AgreementsInasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this compact contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein shall preclude any state entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states.  Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.
Article VIII. CompensationEach party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.
Article IX. ReimbursementAny party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests;  provided that any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense or other cost or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost;  and provided further that any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states.  Article VIII expenses shall not be reimbursable under this article.
Article X. EvacuationPlans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management/services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur.  Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors.  Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items.  Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come.  After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees.
Article XI. Implementation
A. This compact shall become effective immediately upon its enactment into law by any two states.  Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon enactment by such state.

B. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until 30 days after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors of all other party states.  Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.

C. Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States Government.

ARTICLE I. PURPOSE

The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the Bylaws and Rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions.  The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 
4 U.S.C. § 112
 (relating to compacts between States for cooperation in prevention of crime;  consent of Congress), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.  It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states:  to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community;  to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states;  and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.  In addition, this compact will:  create an Interstate Commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact;  ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;  establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators;  monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance;  and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.  The compacting states recognize that there is no “right” of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and Bylaws and Rules promulgated hereunder.  It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

other obligations of the commission, except as may be otherwise provided in the indenture under which they were issued, shall be direct and general obligations of the commission, and the full faith and credit of the commission are hereby pledged for the prompt payment of the debt service thereon and for the fulfillment of all other undertakings of the commission assumed by it to or for the benefit of the holders thereof.13.2.--Funds and Expenses.  The purposes of this compact shall include without limitation thereto all costs of any project or facility or any part thereof, including

bonds are applicable to refunding bonds and to the issuance, sale, or exchange thereof.13.5.--Bonds:  Authorization Generally.  Bonds and other indebtedness of the commission shall be authorized by resolution of the commission.  The validity of the authorization and issuance of any bonds by the commission shall not be dependent upon or affected in any way by:  (1) the disposition of bond proceeds by the commission or by contract, commitment or action taken with respect to such proceeds;  or (2) the failure to complete any part of the project for which bonds are authorized to be issued.  The commission may issue bonds in one or more series and may provide for one or more consolidated bond issues, in such principal amounts and with such terms and provisions as the commission may deem necessary.  The bonds may be secured by a pledge of all or any part of the property, revenues, and franchises under its control.  Bonds may be issued by the commission in such amount, with such maturities and in such denominations and form or forms, whether coupon or registered, as to both principal and interest, as may be determined by the commission.  The commission may provide for

thereof is sufficient to incorporate all of the provisions thereof and of this compact into the body of the bonds and their appurtenant coupons.  Each taker and subsequent holder of the bonds or coupons, whether the coupons are attached to or detached from the bonds, has recourse to all of the provisions of the indenture and of this compact and is bound thereby.13.7.--Maximum Maturity.  No bond or its terms shall mature in more than fifty years from its own date, or on any date subsequent to the duration of this compact, and in the event any authorized issue is divided into two or more

commission.  If any of the officers whose signatures or countersignatures appear upon the bonds or coupons ceases to be an officer before the delivery of the bonds or coupons, his signature or countersignature is nevertheless valid and of the same force and effect as if the officer had remained in office until the delivery of the bonds and coupons.13.12.--Holding Own Bonds.  The commission shall have power out of any funds available therefor to purchase its bonds and may hold, cancel, or resell such bonds.13.13.--Sale.  The commission may fix terms and conditions for the sale or other disposition of any authorized issue of bonds and may sell its bonds at less than their par or face value.  All bonds issued and sold for cash pursuant to this compact shall be sold on sealed proposals to the highest bidder.  Prior to such sale, the commission shall advertise for bids by publication of a notice of sale not less than ten days prior to the date of sale, at least once in a newspaper of general circulation printed and published in New York City carrying municipal bonds notices and devoted primarily to financial news.  The commission may reject any and all bids submitted and may thereafter sell the bonds so advertised for sale at private sale to any financially responsible bidder under such terms and conditions as it deems most advantageous to the public interest, but the bonds shall not be sold at a net interest cost calculated upon the entire issue so advertised, greater than the lowest bid which was rejected.  In the event the commission desires to issue its bonds in exchange for an existing facility or portion thereof, or in exchange for bonds secured by the revenues of an existing facility, it may exchange such bonds for the existing facility or portion thereof or for the bonds so secured, plus an additional amount of cash, without advertising such bonds for sale.13.14.--Negotiability.  All bonds issued under the provisions of this compact are negotiable instruments, except when registered in the name of a registered owner.13.15.--Legal Investments.  Bonds of the commission shall be legal investments for savings banks, fiduciaries and public funds in each of the signatory states.13.16.--Validation Proceedings.  Prior to the issuance of any bonds, the commission may institute a special proceeding to determine the legality of proceedings to issue the bonds and their validity under the laws of any of the signatory parties.  Such proceedings shall be instituted and prosecuted in rem, and the judgment rendered therein shall be conclusive against all persons whomsoever and against each of the signatory parties.13.17.--Recording.  No indenture need be recorded or filed in any public office, other than the office of the commission.  The pledge of revenues provided in any indenture shall take effect forthwith as provided therein and irrespective of the date of receipts of such revenues by the commission or the indenture trustee.  Such pledge shall be effective as provided in the indenture without physical delivery of the revenues to the commission or the indenture trustee.13.18.--Pledged Revenues.  Bond redemption and interest payments, to the extent provided in the resolution or indenture, shall constitute a first, direct and exclusive charge and lien on all such rates, rents, tolls, fees, and charges and other revenues and interest thereon received from the use and operation of the facility, and on any sinking or other funds created therefrom.  All such rates, rents, tolls, fees, charges and other revenues, together with interest thereon, shall constitute a trust fund for the security and payment of such bonds, and except as and to the extent provided in the indenture with respect to the payment therefrom of expenses for other purposes including administration, operation, maintenance, improvements, or extensions of the facilities or other purposes shall not be used or pledged for any other purpose so long as such bonds, or any of them, are outstanding, and unpaid.13.19.--Remedies.  The holder of any bond may for the equal benefit and protection of all holders of bonds similarly situated;  (1) by mandamus or other appropriate proceedings require and compel the performance of any of the duties imposed upon the commission or assumed by it, its officers, agents, or employees under the provisions of any indenture, in connection with the acquisition, construction, operation, maintenance, repair, reconstruction, or insurance of the facilities, or in connection with the collection, deposit, investment, application, and disbursement of the rates, rents, tolls, fees, charges and other revenues derived from the operation and use of the facilities, or in connection with the deposit, investment, and disbursement of the proceeds received from the sale of bonds;  or (2) by action or suit in a court of competent jurisdiction of any signatory party require the commission to account as if it were the trustee of an express trust, or enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful or in violation of the rights of the holders of the bonds.  The enumeration of such rights and remedies, however, does not exclude the exercise or prosecution of any other rights or remedies available to the holders of bonds.

(a) The signatory parties shall provide such capital funds required for projects of the commission as may be authorized by their respective statutes in accordance with a cost sharing plan prepared pursuant to Article 12 of this compact;  but nothing in this section shall be deemed to impose any mandatory obligation on any of the signatory parties other than such obligations as may be assumed by a signatory party in connection with a specific project or facility.(b) Bonds of the commission, notwithstanding any other provision of this compact, may be executed and delivered to any duly authorized agency of any of the signatory parties without public offering and may be sold and resold with or without the guaranty of such signatory party, subject to and in accordance with the constitutions of the respective signatory parties.(c) The commission may receive and accept, and the signatory parties may make, loans, grants, appropriations, advances, and payments of reimbursable or nonreimbursable funds or property in any form for the capital or operating purposes of the commission.

Section 1.3. Purpose and Findings.  The legislative bodies of the respective signatory parties hereby find and declare:

(a) The water resources of the basin are affected with a local, state, regional and national interest and their planning, conservation, utilization, development, management and control, under appropriate arrangements for intergovernmental cooperation, are public purposes of the respective signatory parties.


(b) The water resources of the basin are subject to the sovereign right and responsibility of the signatory parties, and it is the purpose of this compact to provide for a joint exercise of such powers of sovereignty in the common interests of the people of the region.

(d) The water resources of the Delaware River Basin, if properly planned and utilized, are ample to meet all presently projected demands, including existing and added diversions in future years;  and ever increasing economies and efficiencies in the use and reuse of water resources can be brought about by comprehensive planning, programming and management.


(e) In general, the purposes of this compact are to promote interstate comity;  to remove causes of present and future controversy;  to make secure and protect present developments within the state;  to encourage and provide for the planning, conservation, utilization, development, management and control of the water resources of the basin;  to provide for cooperative planning and action by the signatory parties with respect to such water resources;  and to apply the principle of equal and uniform treatment to all water users who are similarly situated and to all users of related facilities, without regard to established political boundaries.

Section 12.8. Tax Exemption.  All bonds issued by the commission under the provisions of this compact and the interest thereof shall at all times be free and exempt from all taxation by or under authority of any of the signatory parties, except for transfer, inheritance and estate taxes.

Section 12.10. Place of Payment.  The commission may provide for the payment of the principal and interest of bonds at any place or places within or without the signatory states, and in any specified lawful coin or currency of the United States of America.


Section 12.11. Execution.  The commission may provide for the execution and authentication of bonds by the manual, lithographed or printed facsimile signature of officers of the commission, and by additional authentication by a trustee or fiscal agent appointed by the commission. [FN10]  If any of the officers whose signatures or counter signatures appear upon the bonds or coupons cease to be officers before the delivery of the bonds or coupons, their signatures or counter signatures are nevertheless valid and of the same force and effect as if the officers had remained in office until the delivery of the bonds and coupons.


Section 12.12. Holding Own Bonds.  The commission shall have power out of any funds available therefor to purchase its bonds and may hold, cancel or resell such bonds.


Section 12.13. Sale.  The commission may fix terms and conditions for the sale or other disposition of any authorized issue of bonds.  The commission may sell bonds at less than their par or face value but no issue of bonds may be sold at an aggregate price below the par or face value thereof if such sale would result in a net interest cost to the commission, calculated upon the entire issue so sold, of more than six percent per annum payable semi-annually, according to standard tables of bond values.  All bonds issued and sold for cash pursuant to this act shall be sold on sealed proposals to the highest bidder.  Prior to such sale, the commission shall advertise for bids by publication of a notice of sale not less than ten days prior to the date of sale, at least once in a newspaper of general circulation printed and published in New York City carrying municipal bond notices and devoted primarily to financial news.  The commission may reject any and all bids submitted and may thereafter sell the bonds as advertised for sale at private sale to any financially responsible bidder under such terms and conditions as it deems most advantageous to the public interest, but the bonds shall not be sold at a net interest cost calculated upon the entire issue so advertised, greater than the lowest bid which was rejected.  In the event the commission desires to issue its bonds in exchange for an existing facility or portion thereof, or in exchange for bonds secured by the revenues of an existing facility, it may exchange such bonds for the existing facility or portion thereof or for the bonds so secured, plus an additional amount of cash, without advertising such bonds for sale.


Section 12.14. Negotiability.  All bonds issued under the provisions of this compact are negotiable instruments, except when registered in the name of a registered owner.


Section 12.15. Legal Investments.  Bonds of the commission shall be legal investments for savings banks, fiduciaries and public funds in each of the signatory states.


Section 12.16. Validation Proceedings.  Prior to the issuance of any bonds, the commission may institute a special proceeding to determine the legality of proceedings to issue the bonds and their validity  [FN11] under the laws of any of the signatory parties.  Such proceeding shall be instituted and prosecuted in rem and the judgment rendered therein shall be conclusive against all persons whomsoever and against each of the signatory parties.


Section 12.17. Recording.  No indenture need be recorded or filed in any public office, other than the office of the commission.  The pledge of revenues provided in any indenture shall take effect forthwith as provided therein and irrespective of the date of receipt of such revenues by the commission or the indenture trustee.  Such pledge shall be effective as provided in the indenture without physical delivery of the revenues to the commission or to the indenture trustee.


Section 12.18. Pledged Revenues.  Bond redemption and interest payments shall, to the extent provided in the resolution or indenture, constitute a first, direct and exclusive charge and lien on all such rates, rents, tolls, fees and charges and other revenues and interest thereon received from the use and operation of the facility, and on any sinking or other funds created therefrom.  All such rates, rents, tolls, fees, charges and other revenues, together with interest thereon, shall constitute a trust fund for the security and payment of such bonds and except as and to the extent provided in the indenture with respect to the payment therefrom of expenses for other purposes including administration, operation, maintenance, improvements or extensions of the facilities or other purposes shall not be used or pledged for any other purpose so long as such bonds, or any of them, are outstanding and unpaid.


Section 12.19. Remedies.  The holder of any bond may for the equal benefit and protection of all holders of bonds similarly situated (a) by mandamus or other appropriate proceedings require and compel the performance of any of the duties imposed upon the commission or assumed by it, its officers, agents or employes  [FN12] under the provisions of any indenture, in connection with the acquisition, construction, operation, maintenance, repair, reconstruction or insurance of the facilities, or in connection with the collection, deposit, investment, application and disbursement of the rates, rents, tolls, fees, charges and other revenues derived from the operation and use of the facilities, or in connection with the deposit, investment and disbursement of the proceeds received from the sale of bonds;  or (b) by action or suit in a court of competent jurisdiction of any signatory party require the commission to account as if it were the trustee of an express trust, or enjoin any acts or things which may be unlawful or in violation of the rights of the holders of the bonds.  The enumeration of such rights and remedies does not, however, exclude the exercise or prosecution of any other rights or remedies available to the holders of bonds.


Section 12.20. Capital Financing by Signatory Parties;  Guarantees.

(a) The signatory parties will provide such capital funds required for projects of the commission as may be authorized by their respective statutes in accordance with a cost sharing plan prepared pursuant to article 11 of this compact;  but nothing in this section shall be deemed to impose any mandatory obligation on any of the signatory parties other than such obligations as may be assumed by a signatory party in connection with a specific project or facility.
