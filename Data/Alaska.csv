(a) The commissioner in consultation with the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development and the local communities may divide a regional educational attendance area into sections only for the purpose of nominating and electing regional school board members.  If the voters in a regional educational attendance area favor election of regional school board members by sections under (b) of this section, the commissioner in consultation with the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development and the local communities shall divide the regional educational attendance area into sections for the purpose of nominating and electing regional school board members.  If a regional educational attendance area is divided into sections each school board member shall represent, as nearly as practicable, an equal number of persons.  The basis for the division of a regional educational attendance area into sections shall be the total population of the area as reported in the most recent decennial federal census.  If the census is five years old or older, then other reliable population data, including population estimates based on public school enrollments, public utility connections, registered voters, or certified employment payrolls, shall be used as the basis for the division of the area into sections.  Each section within a regional educational attendance area shall consist of compact, contiguous territory and, as far as practicable, each section shall contain an integrated socio-economic, linguistically and culturally homogeneous area.  In the division of the regional school and attendance area into sections, consideration shall be given to the transportation and communication network to facilitate the administration of education and communication between communities that comprise the area.  Whenever possible, municipalities, other governmental or regional corporate entities, drainage basins, and other identifiable geographic features shall be used in describing the boundaries of the sections.

(c) If a regional educational attendance area has been divided into sections, the commissioner shall recast the boundaries of the sections within 90 days following the official reporting of the decennial federal census in accordance with (a) of this section.  If the census is five years old or older and other reliable population data acceptable to the department that establishes that board members do not represent as nearly as practicable equal numbers of people under the allocation of seats to a multi-member section under (d) of this section, the commissioner may reallocate the seats among the sections if reallocation will achieve as nearly as practicable equal representation.  Reallocation of seats takes effect at the next regular board election after the reallocation.


(d) Multi-member sections may be created.  However,

(1) each seat on the regional board shall be designated by letter or number and when the declaration of candidacy or other nomination papers of a candidate for the regional school board are filed those papers must indicate the seat that the candidate seeks;  and

(a) The municipal capital project matching grant program is established in the department.  Grants to municipalities under this program shall be administered as provided in this section.


(b) The municipal capital project matching grant fund is established in the department and consists of appropriations to the fund.  Appropriations to the fund do not lapse except as provided in (f) of this section.  The money in the fund is held by the department in custody under this subsection for each municipality.  The department shall establish, for each municipality, an individual grant account within the fund.  As provided in this subsection, each fiscal year the department shall allocate, to the individual grant accounts, appropriations to the fund.  The department shall credit interest earned on money in an individual grant account to that account.  Except as provided in (c) of this section, the amount allocated under this subsection to an individual grant account in a fiscal year is determined by multiplying the total amount appropriated to the fund during that fiscal year by a fraction,

(1) the numerator of which equals for a municipality with a population

(A) under 1,000, the amount equal to that population multiplied by 1.5;


(B) of at least 1,000 but less than 5,000, the amount equal to that population multiplied by 1.4;


(C) of at least 5,000 but not greater than 10,000, the amount equal to that population multiplied by 1.2;


(D) of over 10,000, the amount equal to that population;  and



(2) the denominator of which equals the sum of the numerators calculated for all municipalities under (1)(A) - (D) of this subsection.



(1) the numerator of which equals for a municipality with a population

(A) under 1,000, the amount equal to that population multiplied by 1.5;


(B) of at least 1,000 but less than 5,000, the amount equal to that population multiplied by 1.4;


(C) of at least 5,000 but not greater than 10,000, the amount equal to that population multiplied by 1.2;


(D) of over 10,000, the amount equal to that population;  and



(A) under 1,000, the amount equal to that population multiplied by 1.5;


(B) of at least 1,000 but less than 5,000, the amount equal to that population multiplied by 1.4;


(C) of at least 5,000 but not greater than 10,000, the amount equal to that population multiplied by 1.2;


(D) of over 10,000, the amount equal to that population;  and


(2) the denominator of which equals the sum of the numerators calculated for all municipalities under (1)(A) - (D) of this subsection.


(c) A minimum of $25,000 shall be allocated to each municipality's individual grant account each fiscal year under (b) of this section.  The department shall reduce allocations under (b) of this section on a pro rata basis, based upon the population of the municipalities, if necessary to fund the minimum amount for each municipality.  If appropriations are not sufficient to fully fund the minimum amount for each municipality, the amount appropriated shall be allocated equally among the municipalities' individual grant accounts.


(d) By October 1 of each fiscal year, each municipality shall submit to the governor a prioritized list of capital projects and estimated costs to be financed with money from the municipality's individual grant account established under (b) of this section.  The list must include the amount and source of the local share required by 
AS 37.06.030
.  The governor shall include in the capital improvements program presented to the legislature under 
AS 37.07.060
 the projects submitted by each municipality that the governor recommends for funding.  If, in the capital improvements program, the governor includes projects in other than the priority order submitted by a municipality, the governor shall provide the legislature with a written statement of the reasons for that action.


(e) The legislature may make appropriations from a municipality's individual grant account established under (b) of this section to the municipality for capital projects under this section.  Subject to appropriations under this subsection and to the local share requirements of 
AS 37.06.030
, each municipality may draw amounts from its individual grant account for a capital project, in accordance with an appropriation for that project.  In accepting a draw, the municipality covenants with the state that it will provide for the operation and maintenance of the capital project for which the draw is used for the practical life of the project, and acknowledges that the state is not responsible for operating or maintaining the capital project or for paying for its operation or maintenance.  This requirement does not apply to use of money from a draw for repair or improvement of an existing facility that is operated or maintained by the state at the time that the draw is made if the repair or improvement for which the draw is used will not substantially increase the operating or maintenance costs to the state.  No more than 10 percent of the total amount of money from a draw for land acquisition, or planning, design, construction, or repair of a facility may be used for administrative expenses.  No more than five percent of the total amount of money from a draw for equipment or equipment repairs may be used for administrative expenses.  If a municipality provides grant money from a draw to another recipient, the municipality may not use any of the money from the draw for administrative expenses.  The municipality and its agents, contractors, and subcontractors shall comply with the hiring preferences under AS 36.10 in hiring employees to be paid wholly or in part with money from a draw.


(f) A municipality shall repay to the department money drawn from its individual grant account if substantial, ongoing work on the capital project is not started within five years after the effective date of the appropriation from which the draw is funded.  Money repaid shall be deposited into the general fund.  Money from an allocation to a municipality's individual grant account that has not been drawn out by the municipality within five years after the effective date of the appropriation from which the allocation is funded lapses into the general fund.


(g) For purposes of this section, in calculating the population of a borough, the population of each city in the borough is excluded.  The determination of population shall be based on the latest figures of the United States Bureau of the Census or other population data that the Department of Commerce, Community, and Economic Development determines is reliable.


(h) The provisions of 
AS 37.05.321
 apply to a grant and draws made under this section, and to earnings from the grant and draws.


(i) Before the department may pay a draw under this section to a municipality, the department shall have evidence acceptable to the department that the municipality

(1) has a preventive maintenance plan that

(A) includes a computerized maintenance management program, cardex system, or other formal systematic means of tracking the timing and costs associated with planned and completed maintenance activities, including scheduled preventive maintenance;

(3) unless the alleged noncompliance poses an immediate threat to the public health, give the entity a reasonable amount of time to correct the alleged noncompliance after the department has complied with (1) and (2) of this subsection.


(c) If, after complying with (b) of this section, the department determines that noncompliance still exists and the violation is subject to a penalty under this section, the department may make a preliminary determination to assess the penalty.  The department shall provide notice to the entity of its preliminary determination.  The entity may, within 10 days after receiving the notice, request the department to reconsider its decision.  If a timely request for reconsideration is made, the department shall reconsider its preliminary determination and may affirm or modify the determination.  The department shall notify the entity of the decision.  If a timely request for reconsideration is not received or if, after reconsideration, the department determines that a penalty should be assessed, the department may assess the penalty.  The department shall provide notice of the assessment and instructions for contesting and appealing the assessment to the entity by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested.  The notice must inform the entity of the amount of the proposed penalty and that the entity has 45 days within which to file a notice with the department contesting the proposed penalty.  If, within 45 days after receiving the notification issued by the department, the entity fails to file a notice contesting the proposed penalty, the proposed penalty is considered a final order.  The department may extend the time periods specified in this subsection for good cause.

(f) Unless the notice of appeal is incomplete or otherwise not in conformance with court rules, a notice of appeal under (e) of this section is considered to be filed with the superior court on the day the entity delivers the appropriate documents and fee to the appropriate superior court.  Determining whether the notice of appeal is complete and otherwise in conformance with court rules is the responsibility of the superior court.

"Alaska Statutes Title 14. Education, Libraries, and Museums § 14.20.630. Terms and provisions of agreement",https://codes.findlaw.com/ak/title-14-education-libraries-and-museums/ak-st-sect-14-20-630.html,"
(1) The states party to this agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession.  It is the purpose of this agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the states party to it, and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.

(2) The party states find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations.  Variations from state to state in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other states.  As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems.  Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their states of origin, can increase the available educational resources.  Participation in this compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.Article II. DefinitionsAs used in this agreement and contracts made pursuant to it, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

(1) “Educational personnel” means persons who must meet requirements pursuant to state law as a condition of employment in educational programs.


(2) “Designated state official” means the education official of a state selected by that state to negotiate and enter into, on behalf of the state, contracts pursuant to this agreement.


(3) “Accept,” or any variant thereof, means to recognize and give effect to one or more determinations of another state relating to the qualifications of educational personnel in lieu of making or requiring a like determination that would otherwise be required by or pursuant to the laws of a receiving state.


(4) “State” means a state, territory, or possession of the United States;  the District of Columbia;  or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.


(5) “Originating state” means a state (and the subdivisions thereof, if any) whose determination that certain educational personnel are qualified to be employed for specific duties in schools is acceptable in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.


(6) “Receiving state” means a state (and the subdivisions thereof) which accept educational personnel in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.

Article III. Interstate Educational Personnel Contracts(1) The designated state official of a party state may make one or more contracts on behalf of that state with one or more other party states providing for the acceptance of educational personnel.  Any such contract for the period of its duration shall be applicable to and binding on the states whose designated state officials enter into it, and the subdivisions of those states, with the same force and effect as if incorporated in this agreement.  A designated state official may enter into a contract pursuant to this article only with states in which the state official finds that there are programs of education, certification standards or other acceptable qualifications that assure preparation or qualification of educational personnel on a basis sufficiently comparable, even though not identical to that prevailing in the official's state.

(2) Any such contract shall provide for:

(a) Its duration.


(b) The criteria to be applied by an originating state in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving state.


(c) Such waivers, substitutions, and conditional acceptances as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract without sacrifice of basic educational standards.


(d) Any other necessary matters.



(a) Its duration.


(b) The criteria to be applied by an originating state in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving state.


(c) Such waivers, substitutions, and conditional acceptances as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract without sacrifice of basic educational standards.


(d) Any other necessary matters.


(3) No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall be for a term longer than five years but any such contract may be renewed for like or lesser periods.


(4) Any contract dealing with acceptance of educational personnel on the basis of their having completed an educational program shall specify the earliest date or dates on which originating state approval of the program or programs involved can have occurred.  No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall require acceptance by a receiving state of any persons qualified because of successful completion of a program prior to January 1, 1954.


(5) The certification or other acceptance of a person who has been accepted pursuant to the terms of a contract shall not be revoked or otherwise impaired because the contract has expired or been terminated.  However, any certificate or other qualifying document may be revoked or suspended on any ground which would be sufficient for revocation or suspension of a certificate or other qualifying document initially granted or approved in the receiving state.


(6) A contract committee composed of the designated state officials of the contracting states or their representatives shall keep the contract under continuous review, study means of improving its administration, and report no less frequently than once a year to the heads of the appropriate education agencies of the contracting states.

Article IV. Approved and Accepted Programs(1) Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to repeal or otherwise modify any law or regulation of a party state relating to the approval of programs of educational preparation having effect solely on the qualification of educational personnel within that state.
(2) To the extent that contracts made pursuant to this agreement deal with the educational requirements for the proper qualification of educational personnel, acceptance of a program of educational preparation shall be in accordance with such procedures and requirements as may be provided in the applicable contract.Article V. Interstate CooperationThe party states agree that:

(1) They will, so far as practicable, prefer the making of multilateral contracts pursuant to Article III of this agreement.

(2) They will facilitate and strengthen cooperation in interstate certification and other elements of educational personnel qualification and for this purpose shall cooperate with agencies, organizations, and associations interested in certification and other elements of educational personnel qualification.Article VI. Agreement EvaluationThe designated state officials of any party states may meet from time to time as a group to evaluate progress under the agreement, and to formulate recommendations for changes.Article VII. Other ArrangementsNothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent or inhibit other arrangements or practices of any party state or states to facilitate the interchange of educational personnel.
Article VIII. Effect and Withdrawal(1) This agreement shall become effective when enacted into law by two states.  Thereafter it shall become effective as to any state upon its enactment of this agreement.

(2) Any party state may withdraw from this agreement by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states.

(3) No withdrawal shall relieve the withdrawing state of any obligation imposed upon it by a contract to which it is a party.  The duration of contracts and the methods and conditions of withdrawal therefrom shall be those specified in their terms.Article IX. Construction and SeverabilityThis agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof.  The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States, or the application thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstances is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.  If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters."

 and a party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state in accordance with this compact is not liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection with the rendering of that aid.  Good faith in this article does not include wilful misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness.ARTICLE VIISUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENTSInasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party to the compact, this instrument contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing contained in the compact precludes any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affects any other agreements already in force between states.  Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but are not limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.ARTICLE VIIICOMPENSATIONEach party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case those members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid under this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.ARTICLE IXREIMBURSEMENTAny party state rendering aid in another state under this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving the aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such a request;  however, any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part the loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or may loan equipment or donate services to the receiving party state without charge or cost and, further, any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states.  Article VIII expenses are not reimbursable under this provision.ARTICLE XEVACUATIONPlans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant, shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management or services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur.  The plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting the evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing, and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of the evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors.  The plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for the evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items.  Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come.  After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of the evacuees.
ARTICLE XIIMPLEMENTATION(a) This compact becomes operative immediately upon its enactment into law by any two states;  after that, this compact becomes effective as to any other state upon its enactment by that state.

(b) Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the compact, but the withdrawal does not take effect until 30 days after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states.  The action does not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed under the compact before the effective date of withdrawal.

(c) Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of any supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States government.ARTICLE XIIVALIDITYThis Act shall be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in Article I of this compact.  If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional, or the applicability of the compact to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of this compact and the applicability of the compact to other persons and circumstances are not affected by the invalidity of any provision of the compact.ARTICLE XIIIADDITIONAL PROVISIONSNothing in this compact authorizes or permits the use of military force by the National Guard of a state at any place outside that state in any emergency for which the President is authorized by law to call into federal service the militia, or for any purpose for which the use of the Army or the Air Force would in the absence of express statutory authorization be prohibited under 
18 U.S.C. 1385

AS 47.27.040(b)
 in establishing paternity or establishing, modifying, or enforcing a child support order requiring the payment of support by the noncustodial parent for a dependent child for whom assistance is received.  The child support services agency shall inform the Alaska Native family assistance program if it determines that the participant is not in good faith compliance with the requirements of 
AS 47.27.040(b)
.  The Alaska Native family assistance program shall determine whether the participant has good cause for refusing to cooperate.


(n) An Alaska Native family assistance program that receives assignments of ongoing child support shall provide public assistance information concerning those assignments to the child support services agency in a timely manner in order to establish a valid assignment.  The information shall be provided by electronic means and in a format acceptable to the child support services agency.  For the purposes of this subsection, “timely manner” means within the time constraints established for child support agency distributions under federal law.

(12) is not limited by the provisions of 
AS 38.05.134(3) or (f)
 of this section in the commissioner's determination under this subsection.


(k) The commissioner shall define all terms and adopt all regulations necessary for a reasonable understanding and evaluation of a particular bidding method before the public announcement of the terms of proposed sale employing that method.


(l) Subject to the provisions of AS 31.05, the commissioner has discretion to enter into an agreement whereby, with the consent of the lessee, the state's royalty share of production of oil and gas or gas only may be stored or retained in storage by the lessee, or the commissioner may enter into an agreement with one or more of the affected field lease holders to trade current royalty production from a field for a like amount, kind, and quality of future production, on the condition that the state receives back its stored or traded royalty share during the first half of the estimated field life or no later than 15 years after start of production, whichever is sooner.


(m) An oil and gas lease or a gas only lease must cover a reasonably compact area not exceeding 5,760 acres, and may be for a maximum period of 10 years, except that the commissioner may issue a lease for a period not less than five years upon a finding that it is in the best interests of the state.  An oil and gas lease or gas only lease shall be extended beyond its primary term if, at the end of the primary term, oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the lease and for so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the lease or if the lease is committed to a unit approved by the commissioner.  If a lease is not automatically extended under this subsection, the commissioner may approve a one-time extension of the primary term of an oil and gas lease or gas only lease upon written application by the lessee if the commissioner finds that the extension is in the best interest of the state.  A person requesting a one-time extension shall send the request to the commissioner at least 180 days before the expiration date of the primary term of the lease.  The length of the primary term of the lease combined with the term of the one-time extension may not exceed a total of 10 years.  The commissioner shall consider the funds expended by the lessee to explore and develop the lease, the types of work completed by or on behalf of a lessee, and any other relevant information in deciding whether to extend the lease.  Notwithstanding the provisions of (h) of this section, the commissioner may condition a lease extension on posting of a performance bond by the lessee, meeting a minimum work commitment, or both.  The work commitment, if required, must be expressed in terms of money to be spent or type and amount of work to be performed.  A lease issued under this section covering land on which there is a well capable of producing oil or gas in paying quantities does not expire because the lessee fails to produce oil or gas unless the lessee is allowed reasonable time to place the well on a producing status.  Upon extension, if oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the lease or the lease is committed to a unit approved by the commissioner, the commissioner may increase lease rentals so long as the increased rental rate does not exceed 150 percent of the rate for the preceding year.  If the commissioner grants a one-time lease extension, upon extension, the rental for the last three years of a lease extension shall increase to $250 an acre for each year, except that, at the commissioner's discretion, the rental may be less than $250 an acre if the commissioner determines that a lessee has exercised reasonable diligence to explore and develop the lease during the primary term.  If drilling, including operations such as redrilling, sidetracking, or using other means necessary to reach the originally proposed bottom hole location, has commenced on the expiration date of the primary term of the lease and is continued with reasonable diligence, the lease continues in effect until 90 days after drilling has ceased and for so long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.  An oil and gas lease or a gas only lease issued under this section that is subject to termination by reason of cessation of production does not terminate if, within 60 days after production ceases, reworking or drilling operations are commenced on the land under lease and are thereafter conducted with reasonable diligence during the period of nonproduction.


(n) The commissioner may establish by regulation that after a well has been plugged and abandoned, the rental rate that was in effect during the year of abandonment is maintained for the remainder of the term.  Rental is payable in advance and continues until income to the state from royalty or net profit share exceeds rental income to the state for that year.  Except as provided in (m) and (w) of this section,

(1) an oil and gas or gas only lease must provide for payment to the state of rental on the following basis:

(A) for the first year, $1.00 an acre;


(B) for the second year, $1.50 an acre;


(C) for the third year, $2.00 an acre;


(D) for the fourth year, $2.50 an acre;


(E) for the fifth and following years, $3.00 an acre;



(2) if the lessee under a gas only lease demonstrates to the commissioner that the potential resources underlying the lease are reasonably estimated to be only nonconventional gas,

(A) the rental payment is $1.00 an acre until the lease expires or paying quantities of conventional oil or gas are discovered underlying the lease;  and


(B) if the nonconventional gas produced will not be in direct competition with gas on which a royalty at a rate of at least 12.5 percent is payable, then the royalty share payable to the state on all production of gas from the pool attributable to that lease shall be 6.25 percent based on production delivered in pipeline quality and free of all lease expenses, including separation, cleaning, dehydration, gathering, salt water disposal, and preparation for transportation off the lease.

(A) for the first year, $1.00 an acre;


(B) for the second year, $1.50 an acre;


(C) for the third year, $2.00 an acre;


(D) for the fourth year, $2.50 an acre;


(E) for the fifth and following years, $3.00 an acre;



(A) for the first year, $1.00 an acre;


(B) for the second year, $1.50 an acre;


(C) for the third year, $2.00 an acre;


(D) for the fourth year, $2.50 an acre;


(E) for the fifth and following years, $3.00 an acre;


(2) if the lessee under a gas only lease demonstrates to the commissioner that the potential resources underlying the lease are reasonably estimated to be only nonconventional gas,

(A) the rental payment is $1.00 an acre until the lease expires or paying quantities of conventional oil or gas are discovered underlying the lease;  and


(B) if the nonconventional gas produced will not be in direct competition with gas on which a royalty at a rate of at least 12.5 percent is payable, then the royalty share payable to the state on all production of gas from the pool attributable to that lease shall be 6.25 percent based on production delivered in pipeline quality and free of all lease expenses, including separation, cleaning, dehydration, gathering, salt water disposal, and preparation for transportation off the lease.



(A) the rental payment is $1.00 an acre until the lease expires or paying quantities of conventional oil or gas are discovered underlying the lease;  and


(B) if the nonconventional gas produced will not be in direct competition with gas on which a royalty at a rate of at least 12.5 percent is payable, then the royalty share payable to the state on all production of gas from the pool attributable to that lease shall be 6.25 percent based on production delivered in pipeline quality and free of all lease expenses, including separation, cleaning, dehydration, gathering, salt water disposal, and preparation for transportation off the lease.


(o) Upon timely application as provided by regulation, the state may issue to the holder of a federal or private lease, a state shoreland lease covering land within the exterior boundaries of the federal or private lease which has been excluded on the basis of navigability or which is later administratively or judicially determined to be shoreland.  The term of such a state shoreland lease shall be the same as the term of the federal or private lease.


(p) To conserve the natural resources of all or a part of an oil or gas pool, field, or like area, the lessees and their representatives may unite with each other, or jointly or separately with others, in collectively adopting or operating under a cooperative or a unit plan of development or operation of the pool, field, or like area, or a part of it, when determined and certified by the commissioner to be necessary or advisable in the public interest.  The commissioner may, with the consent of the holders of leases involved, establish, change, or revoke drilling, producing, and royalty requirements of the leases and adopt regulations with reference to the leases, with like consent on the part of the lessees, in connection with the institution and operation of a cooperative or unit plan as the commissioner determines necessary or proper to secure the proper protection of the public interest.  The commissioner may not reduce royalty on leases in connection with a cooperative or unit plan except as provided in (j) of this section.  The commissioner may require a lease issued under this section to contain a provision requiring the lessee to operate under a reasonable cooperative or unit plan, and may prescribe a plan under which the lessee must operate.  The plan must adequately protect all parties in interest, including the state.


(q) A plan authorized by (p) of this section, which includes land owned by the state, may contain a provision vesting the commissioner, or a person, committee, or state agency, with authority to modify from time to time the rate of prospecting and development and the quantity and rate of production under the plan.  All leases operated under a plan approved or prescribed by the commissioner are excepted in determining holdings or control under 
AS 38.05.140
.  The provisions of this section concerning cooperative or unit plans are in addition to and do not affect AS 31.05.


(r) Producing acreage on a known geologic structure of a producing oil or gas field is excluded from chargeability as against the acreage limitation provisions of 
AS 38.05.140
.


(s) When separate tracts cannot be individually developed and operated in conformity with an established well-spacing or development program, a lease, or a portion of a lease, may be pooled with other land, whether or not owned by the state, under a communitization or drilling agreement providing for an apportionment of production or royalties among the separate tracts of land comprising the drilling or spacing unit when determined by the commissioner to be in the public interest.  Operations or production under the agreement are considered as operations or production as to each lease committed to the agreement.  The commissioner may not reduce royalty on leases in connection with a communitization or drilling agreement except as provided in (j) of this section.


(t) The commissioner may prescribe conditions and approve, on conditions, drilling, or development contracts made by one or more lessees of oil or gas leases, with one or more persons, when, in the discretion of the commissioner, the conservation of natural resources or the public convenience or necessity requires it or the interests of the state are best served.  All leases operated under approved drilling or development contracts and interests under them, are excepted in determining holding or control under 
AS 38.05.140
.  The commissioner may not reduce royalty on a lease or leases that are subject to a drilling or development contract except as provided in (j) of this section.


(u) To avoid waste or to promote conservation of natural resources, the commissioner may authorize the subsurface storage of oil or gas, whether or not produced from state land, in land leased or subject to lease under this section.  This authorization may provide for the payment of a storage fee or rental on the stored oil or gas, or, instead of the fee or rental, for a royalty other than that prescribed in the lease when the stored oil or gas is produced in conjunction with oil or gas not previously produced.  A lease on which storage is so authorized shall be extended at least for the period of storage and so long thereafter as oil or gas not previously produced is produced in paying quantities.  Notwithstanding the authorization for payments under this subsection, when requested by a lessee, the commissioner shall exempt a gas storage facility that qualifies for a tax credit under 
AS 43.20.046
 from any payment described in this subsection for the periods described in this subsection.  The exemption is available for the calendar year in which the facility commences commercial operation and for each of the nine calendar years immediately following the first year of commercial operation;  however, an exemption is not applicable for the calendar year after the facility ceases commercial operation or for any subsequent calendar year.  The lessee shall provide the commissioner with any information the commissioner requests to determine if the exemption applies.  The information related to state land leased for a gas storage facility under this subsection is public information and may be furnished to the Regulatory Commission of Alaska.  On request, the commissioner shall provide the name of each person using state land leased for a gas storage facility under this chapter, the years for which an exemption was granted, and the amount of the exemption.  Gas withdrawn from a gas storage facility regulated under AS 42.05 is considered to be non-native gas and is not considered to be produced and subject to royalty until all non-native gas injected into the gas storage facility has been withdrawn from the gas storage facility.  A person receiving an exemption for a payment under this section that contracts to store gas for a utility regulated under AS 42.05 shall reduce the storage price to reflect the value of the exemption.  In this subsection, “ceases commercial operation,” “commences commercial operation,” “gas storage facility,” and “non-native gas” have the meanings given in 
AS 31.05.032
.


(v) Repealed.


(w) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, land that was subject to a best interest finding issued within the previous 10 years may be, at the discretion of the commissioner, immediately offered for lease, under regulations adopted by the commissioner, upon terms appearing most advantageous to the state;  however, noncompetitive leasing is prohibited.  The commissioner shall establish a royalty determined to be in the public interest but not less than 12 1/2 percent.  A lease must provide for payment to the state of rental but need not adhere to the rental schedule in (n) of this section nor to the 5,760-acres-per-lease limitation in (m) of this section.  The lease term may not exceed 10 years, except as provided in (o) of this section.


(x) A lessee conducting or permitting any exploration for, or development or production of, oil or gas on state land shall provide the commissioner access to all noninterpretive data obtained from that lease and shall provide copies of that data, as the commissioner may request.  The confidentiality provisions of 
AS 38.05.035
 apply to the information obtained under this subsection.


(y) A noncompetitive lease existing at October 10, 1978, shall be extended for a period of two years and so long thereafter as oil and gas is produced in paying quantities.  A noncompetitive lease extended under this subsection is subject to the regulations in force at the expiration of the initial five-year term of the lease.  No extension may be granted, however, unless within a period of 90 days before the expiration date an application for extension is filed by the record title holder or an assignee whose assignment has been filed for approval, or an operator whose operating agreement has been filed for approval.


(z) No leases may be issued under this section without the inclusion of the following language:  “The landowners' royalty share of the unit production allocated to each separately owned tract shall be regarded as royalty to be distributed to and among, or the proceeds of it paid to, the landowners, free and clear of all unit expense and free of any lien for it.”  Leases issued in violation of this subsection shall, for all purposes, be construed as containing the language required by this subsection.


(aa) Within 90 days after the written request of a lessee of a lease issued under this section or of a lessee of federal land from which the state is entitled under applicable federal law to receive a share of the royalty on gas production, the commissioner shall enter into an agreement with the lessee to use or accept, as the value of the state's royalty share of gas production, the price for the gas established in the contract between the lessee and a gas or electric utility sold by the lessee under the contract or the transfer price between the lessee and a gas or electric utility for a transfer by the lessee under an order establishing the transfer price

(1) but only if the primary function of the utility with which the lessee has entered into the contract or transfer is to provide, either directly or by selling at wholesale to another utility, gas or electricity to the general public, including residential consumers, within the utilities' service areas, and the utility with which the lessee has entered into

(A) the contract is not an affiliated interest, as that term is defined in 
AS 42.05.990
, with the lessee or with a subsequent purchaser of more than 10 percent of the utility's gas or electricity;  or


(B) the transfer is an affiliated interest, as that term is defined in 
AS 42.05.990
, and the transfer price between the lessee and the utility is established by an order of the Regulatory Commission of Alaska;  and



(2) unless the commissioner makes a written finding, based on clear and convincing evidence, that

(A) the contract price or transfer price is unreasonably low;


(B) the prospective reduction in royalty receipts would not be balanced by increased benefits to in-state gas and electric consumers;


(C) the lessee and the utility are related in management, ownership, or other aspect and, in the case of a transfer price, that relationship is not regulated under AS 42.05;  and


(D) the contract price or transfer price is not in the best interest of the state.




(1) but only if the primary function of the utility with which the lessee has entered into the contract or transfer is to provide, either directly or by selling at wholesale to another utility, gas or electricity to the general public, including residential consumers, within the utilities' service areas, and the utility with which the lessee has entered into

(A) the contract is not an affiliated interest, as that term is defined in 
AS 42.05.990
, with the lessee or with a subsequent purchaser of more than 10 percent of the utility's gas or electricity;  or

(p) Where there is a valid municipal entitlement selection on state land under 
AS 29.65.010
--
29.65.030
 that has a state-issued land lease that has been issued competitively under 
AS 38.05.070
 and before the decision to approve the municipal entitlement land selection, the director shall grant a preference right to purchase without further competitive bid of up to five acres of the state land to an individual who has erected a building approved by a lease on the state land and used the land for bona fide business purposes for 10 or more years under a state lease, if the business produced not less than 25 percent of the total income of the applicant for the 10 years preceding the application to purchase the land.  An application for a preference right under this section must be filed with the director within 120 days after notice to the lessee of the municipal entitlement land selection.  If the director grants the preference right, the director shall sell the land at a price determined by the director to represent the current fair market value of the unimproved land determined by an appraisal under 
AS 38.05.840
 and a survey, both at the cost of the applicant.  If the director determines that the purchase of the land would interfere with public use by residents of the area, the director may condition the purchase to mitigate the adverse effects on the public in the written finding under (e) of this section or may reject the application if those effects cannot be avoided or mitigated.  If the preference right application is approved, the amount of land within the overall municipal entitlement under 
AS 29.65.010
--
29.65.030
 shall be reduced by the amount of land covered under this section;  however, subject to appropriation, the revenue from the purchase of the parcel will be given to the municipality if the municipal entitlement land selection is approved.
