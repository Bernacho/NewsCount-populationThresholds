(3)(a) For the purpose of allocating the funds in subsections (2)(b) and (2)(c) to a consolidated city-county government, each entity must be considered to have separate city and county boundaries.  The city limit boundaries are the last official city limit boundaries for the former city unless revised boundaries based on the location of the urban area have been approved by the department of transportation and must be used to determine city and county populations and road mileages in the following manner:

(i) Percentage factors must be calculated to determine separate populations for the city and rural county by using the last official decennial federal census population figures that recognized an incorporated city and the rural county.  The factors must be based on the ratio of the city to the rural county population, considering the total population in the county minus the population of any other incorporated city or town in the county.


(ii) The city and county populations must be calculated by multiplying the total county population, as determined by the latest official decennial census or the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census, minus the population of any other incorporated city or town in that county, by the factors established in subsection (3)(a)(i).

7-1-4111
, may each year expend no more than 25% of the funds allocated to that town or third-class city for the purchase of capital equipment and supplies to be used for the maintenance and repair of town or third-class city streets and alleys.  The governing body of a town or third-class city may place all or a part of the 25% in a restricted asset account within the gas tax apportionment fund that is carried forward until there is a need for the expenditure.


(5) All funds allocated by this section to counties, cities, towns, and consolidated city-county governments must be disbursed to the lowest responsible bidder according to applicable bidding procedures followed in all cases in which the contract for construction, reconstruction, maintenance, or repair is in excess of the amounts provided in 
7-5-2301
 and 
7-5-4302
.


(6) For the purposes of this section in which distribution of funds is made on a basis related to population, the population must be determined annually for counties and biennially for cities according to the latest official decennial census or the latest interim year population estimates from the Montana department of commerce as supplied by the United States bureau of the census.


(7) For the purposes of this section in which determination of mileage is necessary for distribution of funds, it is the responsibility of the cities, towns, counties, and consolidated city-county governments to furnish to the department of transportation a yearly certified statement indicating the total mileage within their respective areas applicable to this chapter.  All mileage submitted is subject to review and approval by the department of transportation.

(2) In the development of legislative districts, a plan is subject to the Voting Rights Act and must comply with the following criteria, in order of importance:

(a) The districts must be as equal as practicable, meaning to the greatest extent possible, within a plus or minus 1% relative deviation from the ideal population of a district as calculated from information provided by the federal decennial census. The relative deviation may be exceeded only when necessary to keep political subdivisions intact or to comply with the Voting Rights Act.


(b) District boundaries must coincide with the boundaries of political subdivisions of the state to the greatest extent possible. The number of counties and cities divided among more than one district must be as small as possible. When there is a choice between dividing local political subdivisions, the more populous subdivisions must be divided before the less populous, unless the boundary is drawn along a county line that passes through a city.


(c) The districts must be contiguous, meaning that the district must be in one piece. Areas that meet only at points of adjoining corners or areas separated by geographical boundaries or artificial barriers that prevent transportation within a district may not be considered contiguous.


(d) The districts must be compact, meaning that the compactness of a district is greatest when the length of the district and the width of a district are equal. A district may not have an average length greater than three times the average width unless necessary to comply with the Voting Rights Act.

(ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is the lesser of:

(A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor;  or


(B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.



(iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1.  Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.


(iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:

(A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;


(B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;


(C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).  The rate must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).





(4)(a) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iv) and (7)(b), the base entitlement share pool must be increased annually by an entitlement share growth rate as provided for in this subsection (4).  The amount determined through the application of annual growth rates is the entitlement share pool for each fiscal year.


(b) By October 1 of each year, the department shall calculate the growth rate of the entitlement share pool for the next fiscal year in the following manner:

(i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as recorded on the statewide budgeting and accounting system.  The first factor is the sum of the revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75.  The second factor is the sum of the revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.25.

(A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor;  or


(B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.



(iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1.  Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.


(iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:

(i) The department shall calculate the entitlement share growth rate based on the ratio of two factors of state revenue sources for the first, second, and third most recently completed fiscal years as recorded on the statewide budgeting and accounting system.  The first factor is the sum of the revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from the sources referred to in subsections (2)(b), (2)(c), and (2)(g) divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.75.  The second factor is the sum of the revenue for the first and second previous completed fiscal years received from individual income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 30, and corporate income tax as provided in Title 15, chapter 31, divided by the sum of the revenue for the second and third previous completed fiscal years received from the same sources multiplied by 0.25.


(ii) Except as provided in subsections (4)(b)(iii) and (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is the lesser of:

(A) the sum of the first factor plus the second factor;  or


(B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.

(B) 1.03 for counties, 1.0325 for consolidated local governments, and 1.035 for cities and towns.


(iii) In no instance can the entitlement growth factor be less than 1.  Subject to subsection (4)(b)(iv), the entitlement share growth rate is applied to the most recently completed fiscal year entitlement payment to determine the subsequent fiscal year payment.


(iv) The entitlement share growth rate, as described in this subsection (4), is:

(A) for fiscal year 2018, 1.005;


(B) for fiscal year 2019, 1.0187;


(C) for fiscal year 2020 and thereafter, determined as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).  The rate must be applied to the entitlement payment for the previous fiscal year as if the payment had been calculated using entitlement share growth rates for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as provided in subsection (4)(b)(ii).

(1) The legislature, mindful of its constitutional obligations under 
Article II, section 3
, and Article IX of the Montana constitution, has enacted the Open-Space Land and Voluntary Conservation Easement Act.

(2) The legislature finds that:

(a) the rapid growth and spread of urban development are creating critical problems of service and finance for the state and local governments;


(b) the present and future rapid population growth in urban areas is creating severe problems of urban and suburban living;


(c) this population spread and its attendant development are disrupting and altering the remaining natural areas, biotic communities, and geological and geographical formations and thereby providing the potential for the destruction of scientific, educational, aesthetic, and ecological values;


(d) the present and future rapid population spread throughout the state of Montana into its open spaces is creating serious problems of lack of open space and overcrowding of the land;


(e) to lessen congestion and to preserve natural, ecological, geographical, and geological elements, the provision and preservation of open-space lands are necessary to secure park, recreational, historic, and scenic areas and to conserve the land, its biotic communities, its natural resources, and its geological and geographical elements in their natural state;


(f) the acquisition or designation of interests and rights in real property by certain qualifying private organizations and by public bodies to provide or preserve open-space land is essential to the solution of these problems, the accomplishment of these purposes, and the health and welfare of the citizens of the state;


(g) the exercise of authority to acquire or designate interests and rights in real property to provide or preserve open-space land and the expenditure of public funds for these purposes would be for a public purpose;  and


(h) the statutory provision enabling certain qualifying private organizations to acquire interests and rights in real property to provide or preserve open-space land is in the public interest.

(b) The tax computed under subsection (1)(a) applies to illegally packaged cigarettes under

.


(2) The tax imposed in subsection (1) does not apply to quota cigarettes.


(3) Subject to the refund or credit provided in subsection (4), the tax must be precollected on all cigarettes entering a Montana Indian reservation.


(4) Pursuant to the procedure provided in subsection (5), a wholesaler making a sale of cigarettes to a retailer within the boundaries of a Montana Indian reservation may apply to the department for a refund or credit for taxes precollected on cigarettes sold by the retailer to a member of the federally recognized Indian tribe or tribes on whose reservation the sale is made. A wholesaler who does not file a claim within 1 year of the shipment date forfeits the refund or credit.


(5) The distribution of tax-free cigarettes to a tribal member must be implemented through a system of preapproved wholesaler shipments. A licensed Montana wholesaler shall contact the department for approval prior to the shipment of the untaxed cigarettes. The department may authorize sales based on whether the quota, as established in a cooperative agreement between the department and an Indian tribe or as set out in this chapter, has been met. If authorized as a tax-exempt sale, the wholesaler, upon providing proof of order and delivery to a retailer within the boundaries of a Montana Indian reservation selling cigarettes to members of a federally recognized tribe or tribes of that reservation, must be given a refund or credit. Once the quota has been filled, the department shall immediately notify all affected wholesalers that further sales on that reservation must be taxed and that a claim for a refund or credit will not be honored for the remainder of the quota period. Quota allocations are not transferable between quota periods or between reservations.


(6) The total amount of refunds or credits allowed by the department to all wholesalers claiming the refund or credit under subsection (4) for any month may not exceed an amount that is equal to the tax due on the quota allocation. The department shall determine the amount of refunds or credits for each Indian reservation at the beginning of each fiscal year, using the most recent census data available from the bureau of Indian affairs or as provided in a cooperative agreement with the tribe or tribes of the Indian reservation.


(7) There must be collected and paid to the state of Montana a tax of 50% of the wholesale price, to the wholesaler, of all tobacco products other than cigarettes and moist snuff. The tax on moist snuff is 85 cents an ounce based upon the net weight of the package listed by the manufacturer. For packages of moist snuff that are less than or greater than 1 ounce, the tax must be proportional to the size of the package. Tobacco products shipped from Montana and destined for retail sale and consumption outside the state are not subject to this tax.


(8) The tax imposed by subsection (7) must be precollected and paid by a wholesaler to the department upon sale to a Montana retailer. A wholesaler who fails to report or pay the tax required by this part must be assessed penalty and interest as provided in 
15-1-216
.


(9) A retailer who purchases tobacco products for resale on which the tobacco products tax has not been collected and paid to the department shall comply with all the provisions of this part and the rules adopted to implement this part as if it were a wholesaler.


(10) A retailer must assume that the tobacco products tax has not been collected and paid to the department in the absence of a statement on the retailer's invoice or sales slip for the tobacco products that states that the applicable Montana tobacco products tax is included in the total billing cost.

(1) The legislature finds that the sustainable management of public forests in Montana is vital to conserving the state's natural resources and their economic and ecological potential for the benefit of all Montanans.


(2) The legislature finds that public forests in Montana should be sustainably managed to maintain biodiversity, productivity, regeneration capacity, vitality, and potential to fulfill relevant ecological, economic, and social functions.


(3) The legislature finds that sustainable forest stewardship and management of Montana's public forests requires a balanced approach that ensures a stable timber supply, active restoration, healthy watersheds and fish and wildlife habitat, areas for natural processes, and allowances for multiple uses.


(4) The legislature finds that:

(a) there is overwhelming evidence that the management, protection, and conservation of watersheds in Montana is critical to the well-being of the state;


(b) the water supplies of some of the state's most populous cities and surrounding areas originate in federally managed watersheds that are at risk for catastrophic wildfire, the severity of which could be reduced by proper management;


(c) a catastrophic wildfire in any one of those municipal watersheds would result in ash and sediment inundating and degrading the water supply, leaving tens of thousands of residents without drinking water, creating a severe public safety situation, and decimating millions of dollars worth of water infrastructure;


(d) a burned-out watershed also affects the timing of snow melt and stream flow, which detrimentally affects irrigation and fisheries;  and


(e) federal land managers are not giving due consideration to the constitutionally protected water rights of the state and its citizens, the exercise of which would be impaired by a catastrophic wildfire.

(1) The legislature finds and declares that many Montana citizens have physical disabilities and are unable to use traditional telecommunications equipment and services without assistance. These citizens constitute a substantial and valuable resource within the United States and the state of Montana, and this segment of our population needs access to telecommunications services in order to function as contributing and productive members of our society.


(2) The legislature further finds and declares that the role of telecommunications in our world today is inestimable. Telecommunications is the primary vehicle of commerce and industry, the means to convey and receive information and knowledge, and the way that we connect with others on a personal as well as business level. Telecommunications gives people independence and self-sufficiency, and it provides goods and services, human contact, and fellowship.


(3) The legislature further finds that access to telecommunications services should be provided to persons who have disabilities not only for their own sake but for the benefit of society at large. Access to telecommunications services would enhance the business and personal lives of persons with disabilities, and its availability to persons with disabilities would be an investment of benefit to all of Montana.


(4) Consistent with the findings stated in subsections (1) through (3), the legislature finds it appropriate to provide persons with disabilities access to telecommunications services by creating a program to make specialized telecommunications equipment and services available to persons with disabilities.

Montana Title 20. Education § 20-9-407. Industrial facility agreement for bond issue in excess of maximum,https://codes.findlaw.com/mt/title-20-education/mt-code-ann-sect-20-9-407.html,"
(1) In a school district within which a new major industrial facility that seeks to qualify for taxation as class five property under 
15-6-135
 is being constructed or is about to be constructed, the school district may require, as a precondition of the new major industrial facility qualifying as class five property, that the owners of the proposed industrial facility enter into an agreement with the school district concerning the issuing of bonds in excess of the limitation prescribed in 
20-9-406
.  Under an agreement, the school district may, with the approval of the voters, issue bonds that exceed the limitation prescribed in this section by a maximum of 100% of the estimated taxable value of the property of the new major industrial facility subject to taxation when completed.  The estimated taxable value of the property of the new major industrial facility subject to taxation must be computed by the department of revenue when requested to do so by a resolution of the board of trustees of the school district.  A copy of the department's statement of estimated taxable value must be printed on each ballot used to vote on a bond issue proposed under this section.


(2) Pursuant to the agreement between the new major industrial facility and the school district and as a precondition to qualifying as class five property, the new major industrial facility and its owners shall pay, in addition to the taxes imposed by the school district on property owners generally, as much of the principal and interest on the bonds provided for under this section as represents payment on an indebtedness in excess of the limitation prescribed in 
20-9-406
.  After the completion of the new major industrial facility and when the indebtedness of the school district no longer exceeds the limitation prescribed in this section, the new major industrial facility is entitled, after all the current indebtedness of the school district has been paid, to a tax credit over a period of no more than 20 years.  The credit must as a total amount be equal to the amount that the facility paid the principal and interest of the school district's bonds in excess of its general liability as a taxpayer within the district.


(3) A major industrial facility is a facility subject to the taxing power of the school district, whose construction or operation will increase the population of the district, imposing a significant burden upon the resources of the district and requiring construction of new school facilities.  A significant burden is an increase in ANB of at least 20% in a single year.

(1) The general welfare of the people of Montana, in view of the state's population growth and expanding economy, requires that water resources of the state be put to optimum beneficial use and not wasted.


(2) The public policy of the state is to promote the conservation, development, and beneficial use of the state's water resources to secure maximum economic and social prosperity for its citizens.


(3) The state, in the exercise of its sovereign power, acting through the department of natural resources and conservation, shall coordinate the development and use of the water resources of the state so as to effect full utilization, conservation, and protection of its water resources.


(4) The development and utilization of water resources and the efficient, economic distribution thereof are vital to the people in order to protect existing uses and to assure adequate future supplies for domestic, industrial, agricultural, and other beneficial uses.


(5) The water resources of the state must be protected and conserved to assure adequate supplies for public recreational purposes and for the conservation of wildlife and aquatic life.


(6) The public interest requires the construction, operation, and maintenance of a system of works for the conservation, development, storage, distribution, and utilization of water, which construction, operation, and maintenance is a single object and is in all respects for the welfare and benefit of the people of the state.


(7) It is necessary to coordinate local, state, and federal water resource development and utilization plans and projects through a single agency of state government, the department of natural resources and conservation.


(8) The greatest economic benefit to the people of Montana can be secured only by the sound coordination of development and utilization of water resources with the development and utilization of all other resources of the state.


(9) Any attempt to gain control of or speculate on large quantities of ground water of the state of Montana is not in the interest of the people and is to be restricted.


(10) To achieve these objectives and to protect the waters of Montana from diversion to other areas of the nation, it is essential that a comprehensive, coordinated multiple-use water resource plan be progressively formulated, to be known as the “state water plan”.

(1) The legislature finds that implementing a pilot project for improved youth outcomes may benefit Montana youth who are in the children's mental health system because experiences in other states show that linking provider payments to desired outcomes and quality improvements may result in improved access to care, better integration and coordination of services, child-centered and family-focused planning, earlier and less restrictive interventions, and a reduced number of treatment days.


(2) The department of public health and human services shall establish a pilot project for improving and tracking evidence-based outcomes for providers of children's mental health services and developing performance-based reimbursement options for providers that are identified by an interim study on improved youth outcomes.  The department shall develop the pilot project in accordance with the provisions of this part.


(3) The department of public health and human services shall collect and analyze existing performance data from existing providers and data related to the pilot project in order to determine its effectiveness and to evaluate whether the use of performance-based reimbursement for services should be extended to other services, geographic regions, or populations.


(4) The purpose of the pilot project is to:

(a) improve youth outcomes by stabilizing youth and their families with appropriate services and supports;


(b) improve the partnership and collaborative efforts between the department of public health and human services and providers of children's mental health services;  and


(c) link documented outcomes to performance-based reimbursement options for providers, including but not limited to improvements in:

(i) achieving quality benchmarks;


(ii) integration and coordination of care;


(iii) individualized treatment and care plans;


(iv) focus on community-based services;


(v) efforts to ensure recovery and permanent placement for children who are receiving medicaid mental health services or who are in foster care under the supervision of the state;  and


(vi) cost control.

(1) A person may not operate or knowingly permit a person to operate a motorboat or vessel or manipulate waterskis, a surfboard, or a similar device or other contrivance in a reckless or negligent manner so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of a person by:

(a) engaging in maneuvers that unreasonably or unnecessarily endanger life, limb, or property, including but not limited to weaving through congested vessel traffic or jumping the wake of another vessel unreasonably or unnecessarily close to the other vessel or when visibility around the other vessel is obstructed and including swerving at the last possible moment to avoid collision, following directly behind a waterskier, speeding in confined or restricted areas, and buzzing or wetting down others, which constitute reckless operation of a vessel;


(b) crossing or jumping the wake of another vessel when within 100 yards of the vessel or within 100 yards of a waterskier being towed by the vessel, except when directly entering or leaving a public or private marina, waterski facility, or other watercraft docking or loading area.



(a) engaging in maneuvers that unreasonably or unnecessarily endanger life, limb, or property, including but not limited to weaving through congested vessel traffic or jumping the wake of another vessel unreasonably or unnecessarily close to the other vessel or when visibility around the other vessel is obstructed and including swerving at the last possible moment to avoid collision, following directly behind a waterskier, speeding in confined or restricted areas, and buzzing or wetting down others, which constitute reckless operation of a vessel;


(b) crossing or jumping the wake of another vessel when within 100 yards of the vessel or within 100 yards of a waterskier being towed by the vessel, except when directly entering or leaving a public or private marina, waterski facility, or other watercraft docking or loading area.


(2) A person may not operate a motorboat, including a sailboat propelled by a motor of any kind, or manipulate waterskis, a surfboard, or a similar device attached to a motorboat while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of the two.

(4) A person may not operate or knowingly permit a person to operate a motorboat or vessel at a rate of speed greater than will permit the person, in the exercise of reasonable care, to bring the vessel to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead. However, nothing in this part is intended to prevent the operator of a vessel actually competing in a regatta that is sanctioned by an appropriate governmental unit from attempting to attain high speeds on a marked racing course.


(5) A person may not make a reckless approach to, departure from, or passage by a dock, ramp, diving board, or float.


(6) Skiers being pulled by motorboats must have on their person a United States coast guard approved personal flotation device in good and serviceable condition.


(7) A person may not moor a vessel to buoys or beacons placed in any waters of this state by the authority of the United States, an agency of the United States, or the department or in any manner hang on with a vessel to a buoy or beacon, except in the act of maintenance work on the buoy or beacon, nor may any person deface, remove, or destroy a buoy, beacon, or other authorized navigational marker maintained in the waters of this state.


(8) If an officer whose duty it is to enforce this law observes a vessel being used without sufficient lifesaving or firefighting devices or in an overloaded or other unsafe condition and in the officer's judgment the use creates an especially hazardous condition, the officer may direct the operator to take whatever immediate and reasonable steps would be necessary for the safety of those aboard the vessel, including directing the operator to return to a mooring or launching site and to remain there until the situation creating the hazard is corrected or ended.


(9) The population density and heavy recreational use of certain lakes require a noise standard more restrictive than the standard set in 
23-2-526
 in order to protect the public health and safety. Unless operated on a river or stream in compliance with a rule adopted under 
23-2-521
, a person may not operate a motorboat or personal watercraft on Flathead Lake, situated in Lake and Flathead Counties, Echo Lake, situated in Flathead County, or Swan Lake, situated in Lake County, in proximity to the shoreline if the noise emitted is greater than 75 dbA measured at the shoreline in accordance with the shoreline sound level measurement procedure (SAE J1970).


(10) Unless accompanied by a person 18 years of age or older, a person 12 years of age or younger may not operate a motorboat or a personal watercraft that is powered by a motor rated at more than 10 horsepower. A person 13 or 14 years of age may not operate a vessel or personal watercraft powered by a motor rated at more than 10 horsepower without possessing a valid Montana motorboat operator's safety certificate or evidence of completion of a Montana-approved water safety course or unless accompanied by a person 18 years of age or older.


(11) A person who owns or has charge or control of a motorboat or personal watercraft powered by a motor rated at more than 10 horsepower may not authorize or knowingly permit the motorboat or personal watercraft to be operated:

Montana Title 20. Education § 20-4-121. Interstate agreement on qualification of educational personnel,https://codes.findlaw.com/mt/title-20-education/mt-code-ann-sect-20-4-121.html,"Article I. Purpose--Findings--Policy(1) The states party to this agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession.  It is the purpose of this agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the states party to it and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.
(2) The party states find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations.  Variations from state to state in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other states.  As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators are lost to our school systems.  Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their states of origin, can increase the available educational resources.  Participation in this compact can increase the availability of educational personnel.Article II. DefinitionsAs used in this agreement and contracts made pursuant to it, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the following definitions apply:

(1) “Educational personnel” means persons who must meet requirements pursuant to state law as a condition of employment in educational programs.


(2) “Designated state official” means the educational official of a state selected by that state to negotiate and enter into, on behalf of the official's state, contracts pursuant to this agreement.


(3) “Accept” or any variant thereof means to recognize and give effect to one or more determinations of another state relating to the qualifications of educational personnel in lieu of making or requiring a like determination that would otherwise be required by or pursuant to the laws of a receiving state.


(4) “State” means a state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.


(5) “Originating state” means a state (and the subdivisions thereof, if any) whose determination that certain educational personnel are qualified to be employed for specific duties in schools is acceptable in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.


(6) “Receiving state” means a state (and the subdivisions thereof) which accept educational personnel in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.

Article III. Interstate Educational Personnel Contracts(1) The designated state official of a party state may make one or more contracts on behalf of the designated state official's state with one or more other party states providing for the acceptance of educational personnel.  Any such contract for the period of its duration shall be applicable to and binding on the states whose designated state officials enter into it and the subdivisions of those states with the same force and effect as if incorporated in this agreement.  A designated state official may enter into a contract pursuant to this article only with states in which the designated state official finds that there are programs of education, certification standards, or other acceptable qualifications that assure preparation or qualification of educational personnel on a basis sufficiently comparable even though not identical to that prevailing in the designated state official's own state.

(2) Any such contract shall provide for:

(a) its duration;


(b) the criteria to be applied by an originating state in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving state;


(c) such waivers, substitutions, and conditional acceptance as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract without sacrifice of basic educational standards;  and

(a) its duration;

(c) such waivers, substitutions, and conditional acceptance as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract without sacrifice of basic educational standards;  and


(d) any other necessary matters.


(3) No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall be for a term longer than 5 years, but any such contract may be renewed for like or lesser periods.


(4) Any contract dealing with acceptance of educational personnel on the basis of their having completed an educational program shall specify the earliest date or dates on which originating state approval of the program or programs involved can have occurred.  No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall require acceptance by a receiving state of any persons qualified because of successful completion of a program prior to January 1, 1954.


(5) The certification or other acceptance of a person who has been accepted pursuant to the terms of a contract shall not be revoked or otherwise impaired because the contract has expired or been terminated.  However, any certificate or other qualifying document may be revoked or suspended on any ground which would be sufficient for revocation or suspension of a certificate or other qualifying document initially granted or approved in the receiving state.


(6) A contract committee composed of the designated state officials of the contracting states or their representatives shall keep the contract under continuous review, study means of improving its administration, and report not less than once a year to the heads of the appropriate education agencies of the contracting states.

Article IV. Approved and Accepted Programs(1) Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to repeal or otherwise modify any law or regulation of a party state relating to the approval of programs of educational preparation having effect solely on the qualification of educational personnel within that state.
(2) To the extent that contracts made pursuant to this agreement deal with the educational requirements for the proper qualification of educational personnel, acceptance of a program of educational preparation shall be in accordance with such procedures and requirements as may be provided in the applicable contract.Article V. Interstate CooperationThe party states agree that:

(1) they will, so far as practicable, prefer the making of multilateral contracts pursuant to Article III of this agreement;  and

Agreement EvaluationThe designated state officials of any party states may meet from time to time as a group to evaluate progress under the agreement and to formulate recommendations for changes.Article VII. Other ArrangementsNothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent or inhibit other arrangements or practices of any party state or states to facilitate the interchange of educational personnel.
Article VIII. Effect--Withdrawal(1) This agreement shall become effective when enacted into law by two states.  Thereafter it shall become effective as to any state upon its enactment of this agreement.

(2) Any party state may withdraw from this agreement by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until 1 year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states.

(3) No withdrawal shall relieve the withdrawing state of any obligation imposed upon it by a contract to which it is a party.  The duration of contracts and the methods and conditions of withdrawal therefrom shall be those specified in their terms.Article IX. Construction--SeverabilityThis agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purpose thereof.  The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or the application thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.  If this agreement is held to be contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters."

(b) is subject to regulation under the Montana Major Facility Siting Act, as provided in Title 75, chapter 20;  or


(c) has the potential to emit 250 tons a year or more of any pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter, including fugitive emissions, unless the authority to control the source was delegated to a local air pollution control program prior to January 1, 1991.


(6) If the board finds that the location, character, or extent of particular concentrations of population, air pollutant sources, or geographic, topographic, or meteorological considerations or any combination of these makes impracticable the maintenance of appropriate levels of air quality without an areawide air pollution control program, the board may determine the boundaries within which the program is necessary and require it as the only acceptable alternative to direct state administration.


(7) If the board has reason to believe that any part of an air pollution control program in force under this section is either inadequate to prevent and control air pollution in the jurisdiction to which the program relates or is being administered in a manner inconsistent with this chapter, the board shall, on notice, conduct a hearing on the matter.


(8) If, after the hearing, the board determines that any part of the program is inadequate to prevent and control air pollution in the jurisdiction to which it relates or that it is not accomplishing the purposes of this chapter, it shall require that necessary corrective measures be taken within a reasonable time, not to exceed 60 days.


(9) If the jurisdiction fails to take these measures within the time required, the department shall administer within that jurisdiction all of the provisions of this chapter, including the terms contained in any applicable board order, that are necessary to correct the deficiencies found by the board.  The department's control program supersedes all municipal or county air pollution laws, rules, ordinances, and requirements in the affected jurisdiction.  The cost of the department's action is a charge on the jurisdiction.


(10) If the board finds that the control of a particular air pollutant source because of its complexity or magnitude is beyond the reasonable capability of the local jurisdiction or may be more efficiently and economically performed at the state level, it may direct the department to assume and retain control over that air pollutant source.  A charge may not be assessed against the jurisdiction.  Findings made under this subsection may be either on the basis of the nature of the sources involved or on the basis of their relationship to the size of the communities in which they are located.


(11) A jurisdiction in which the department administers all or part of its air pollution control program under subsection (9) may, with the approval of the board, establish or resume an air pollution control program that meets the requirements of subsection (3).


(12) A municipality or county may administer all or part of its air pollution control program in cooperation with one or more municipalities or counties of this state or of other states.


(13) Local air pollution control programs established under this section shall provide procedures for public notice, public hearing, public comment, and appeal for any proposed new or revised rules, ordinances, or local laws adopted pursuant to this section.  The procedures must comply with the following requirements:

(a) The local air pollution control program shall create and maintain a list of interested persons who wish to be informed of actions related to rules, ordinances, or local laws adopted by the local air pollution control program.


(b) At least 30 days prior to the adoption, revision, or repeal of a rule, ordinance, or law, the local air pollution control program shall give written notice of its intended action.

(C) be written in plain, easily understood language.




(d) For the purposes of subsection (13)(c)(v), a statement of authority to adopt a rule, ordinance, or local law does not, standing alone, constitute a showing of reasonable necessity for the intended action.

(4) The commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the commission are subject to the procedures for audit and accounting established by its bylaws.

The provisions of this compact are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be unconstitutional, or the application of the compact to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact may not be affected. If this compact is held to be contrary to the constitution of any state participating in the compact, the compact remains in effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters."
Montana Title 10. Military Affairs and Disaster and Emergency Services § 10-3-1001. Enactment--provisions,https://codes.findlaw.com/mt/title-10-military-affairs-and-disaster-and-emergency-services/mt-code-ann-sect-10-3-1001.html,"
(1) As used in this compact, the following definitions apply:

(a) “Party states” means the states that enact this compact.


(b) “States” means the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territorial possessions.



(a) “Party states” means the states that enact this compact.


(b) “States” means the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and all U.S. territorial possessions.


(2) This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating party states that enact this compact.


(3) The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the party states in managing any emergency or disaster that is declared by the governor of an affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, human-caused disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack.


(4) This compact also provides for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing, or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, those actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' national guard forces, either in accordance with the National Guard Mutual Assistance Compact or by mutual agreement between party states.

Article II--General Implementation



(1) Each party state recognizes that many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact. Each party state further recognizes that there will be emergencies that require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources that they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.


(2) The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state is the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact must be understood.


(3) On behalf of the governor of each party state, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management is responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.

Article III--Party State Responsibilities



(1) It is the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating those plans and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall:

(a) review individual party state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies that the party states might jointly suffer, whether because of natural disaster, technological hazard, human-caused disaster, emergency aspects of resource shortages, civil disorders, insurgency, or enemy attack;


(b) review party states' individual emergency plans and develop a plan that will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency;


(c) develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans;


(d) assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries;


(e) protect and ensure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services, and resources, both human and material;


(f) inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness;  and


(g) provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes.

The provisions of this agreement apply only to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing. If a request is verbal, the request must be confirmed in writing within 30 days of the verbal request. Requests must provide the following information:

(a) a description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, such as fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue;


(b) the amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials, and supplies needed and a reasonable estimate of the length of time that will be needed;  and


(c) the specific place and time for staging of the assisting party state's response and a point of contact at that location.

(c) the specific place and time for staging of the assisting party state's response and a point of contact at that location.


(3) There must be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States government, with free exchange of information, plans, and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.

Article IV--Limitations

A party state requested to render mutual aid or to conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take action necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms of this compact. However, it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for that state. Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers, except the power of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state, duties, rights, and privileges as are afforded forces of the party state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces shall continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units shall come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or subsequent to commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and must continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid is in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect, or loaned resources remain in the receiving state, whichever is longer.

Article V--Licenses and Permits

If a person holding a license, certificate, or other permit issued by a party state evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical, or other skills is requested for assistance by the receiving party state, that person is considered licensed, certified, or permitted by the party state requesting assistance to render aid involving that skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster. However, the person holding the license, certificate, or permit is subject to limitations and conditions that the governor of the requesting party state may prescribe by executive order or other means.

Article VI--Liability

Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another party state pursuant to this compact are considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes. A party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another party state pursuant to this compact are not liable on account of an act taken or omission made in good faith on the part of the forces giving that aid or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection with giving that aid. Good faith, as used in this article, does not include willful misconduct, gross negligence, or recklessness.

Article VII--Supplementary Agreements

Because it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party to this compact, this compact contains elements of a broad base common to all states. This compact does not prevent a party state from making supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states. Supplementary agreements may include provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.

Article VIII--Compensation

Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of those forces in case those members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.

Article IX--Reimbursement

A party state rendering aid in another party state pursuant to this compact must be reimbursed by the party state receiving that aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with a request. However, an aiding party state may assume in whole or in part a loss, damage, expense, or other cost or may loan equipment or donate services to the receiving party state without charge or cost. Two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states. Article VIII expenses are not reimbursable under this provision.

Article X--Evacuation



(1) Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to require those plans, must be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management or emergency services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur. The plans must be put into effect by request of the party state from which evacuees come and must include:

(a) the manner of transporting those evacuees;


(b) the number of evacuees to be received in different areas;


(c) the manner in which food, clothing, housing, and medical care will be provided;


(d) the registration of the evacuees;


(e) the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends of evacuees;


(f) the forwarding of evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials or supplies;  and

The expenditures must be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come. After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of the evacuees.

Article XI--Implementation



(1) This compact becomes operative immediately upon its enactment into law by any two states. After it becomes operative, this compact is effective in any other state upon its enactment by that other state.


(2) A party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the compact, but withdrawal does not take effect until 30 days after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states. Withdrawal does not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed under this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal.


(3) Authenticated copies of this compact and any supplementary agreements as may be entered into must, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the federal emergency management agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States government.

Article XII--Validity

This compact must be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in Article I.

The compacting states also recognize that Congress has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.


(2) It is the purpose of this compact and the commission to provide the framework for the promotion of public safety, to protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders, to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of offenders by the sending and receiving states, and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.


(3) This compact creates a commission that will:

(a) establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of offenders placed under and released under the jurisdiction of courts, parole officers, correctional institutions, and other criminal justice agencies;


(b) ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;

C. Emergency Fire Suppression.The use of water for emergency fire suppression benefits the public and is necessary for the primary purposes of the National Forest System Lands in Montana. The United States has a federal reserved water right to divert or withdraw water on National Forest System Lands, with the priority date for each Water Court basin set forth in Table 1 of this Compact, from a stream, lake, or pond, as needed for emergency fire suppression for the benefit of National Forest System Lands, and without a definition of the specific elements of a recordable water right, subject to the terms of Article III. Use of water for emergency fire suppression shall not be considered an exercise of the United States' federal reserved water rights for Discrete Administrative Uses as described in Article II, section A., or Dispersed Administrative Uses as described in Article II, section B.D. South Fork Flathead Wild and Scenic River.The United States has a federal reserved water right with a priority date of October 12, 1976, for instream flow on the South Fork Flathead Wild and Scenic River in the amount of the entire flow of the river, less any of the United States' Discrete Administrative Uses as described in Article II, section A., and Dispersed Administrative Uses as described in Article II, section B., provided that the instream flow water right is subordinate to all Water Rights Recognized Under State Law with a priority date before the Effective Date of This Compact. This federal reserved water right ends at the point where the South Fork Flathead Wild and Scenic River flows into Hungry Horse Reservoir.ARTICLE IIIIMPLEMENTATION OF FEDERAL RESERVED WATER RIGHTSA. Abstracts.Abstracts for all the United States' federal reserved water rights for Current Discrete Administrative Use on National Forest System Lands are set forth in Appendix 1. The Parties prepared the Abstracts to comply with the requirements for a final decree as set forth in 
85-2-234, MCA
, and in an effort to assist the state courts in the process of entering decrees accurately and comprehensively reflecting the rights for current Discrete Administrative Uses as described in this Compact. The rights specified in the Abstracts are subject to the terms of this Compact.B. Enforcement and Administration of Federal Reserved Water Rights.1. When a controversy arises between the United States' federal reserved water rights described by this Compact and another holder of a Water Right Recognized Under State Law or, for enforcement pursuant to Article VIII, section B., when there is a question concerning the use of water on National Forest System Lands under this Compact, the United States, the State, or a holder of a Water Right Recognized Under State Law may petition a court of competent jurisdiction for relief. Resolution of any controversy must be governed by the terms of this Compact when applicable or, to the extent not applicable, by appropriate federal or state law.2. For the purpose of the administration of federal reserved water rights provided for in Article II, the United States agrees that a water commissioner or other official appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction may enter National Forest System Lands to collect data, inspect structures for the diversion and measurement of water, and distribute the federal reserved water rights in Article II. The terms of entry or distribution may be limited, as appropriate, by an order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Compact waives the right of the United States, with respect to a specific action or anticipated action by a water commissioner or other official under this subsection, to seek terms of entry or distribution consistent with federal law if in conflict with state law.3. The Department may enter National Forest System Lands for which a federal reserved water right is described in Article II for the purposes of data collection on Forest Service water diversions or notice requirements by the United States, pursuant to Article III, section C.3., of this Compact.C. Use of Federal Reserved Water Rights.1. Federal Reserved Water Rights.The rights of the United States described in Article II of this Compact are federal reserved water rights. Non-use of all or a part of the federal reserved water rights described in this Compact shall not constitute abandonment of the right.2. Development of Future Discrete Administrative Uses.The United States, without prior approval of the Department, may develop a Discrete Administrative Use after the Effective Date of This Compact as described in Article II, section A.2., provided that:
(a) the purpose of use of the water is for a Discrete Administrative Use as defined in Article I(4) and described in Article II, section A.2.;

(b) the quantity of water for Discrete Administrative Uses diverted or withdrawn shall not exceed the total amount as set forth in Article II, Table 1;  and

(c) the use shall not adversely affect a senior Water Right Recognized Under State Law.
3. Use of Dispersed Administrative Uses.The United States, without prior approval of the Department, may use its federal reserved water right for Dispersed Administrative Uses, as needed, provided that:
(a) the purpose of use of the water is for a Dispersed Administrative Use as defined in Article I(5) and described in Article II, section B.;

(b) the total quantity of water for Dispersed Administrative Uses diverted or withdrawn shall not exceed the amount as set forth in Article II, Table 1;

(c) the Forest Service shall provide notice of a Dispersed Administrative Use as follows:

(i) for uses of 20,000 gallons or less per day from a single source of supply, no notice is required;


(ii) for uses greater than 20,000 gallons per day and less than 60,000 gallons per day from a single source of supply, a notice must be posted at the site of the diversion or withdrawal for the entire period during which water is being diverted or withdrawn. The notice posted shall be clearly legible and visible and provide the following information:

(A) source of water;


(B) purpose of use;


(C) starting and ending date of diversion;


(D) place of use;


(E) diversion flow rate;


(F) maximum volume of water to be diverted or withdrawn per day;  and


(G) name and contact information for the contractor, the local Forest Service Ranger District, and the local Department Water Resources Regional Office.



(iii) for uses greater than 60,000 gallons per day from a single source of supply, the local Department Water Resources Regional Office must be notified at least 10 days but not more than 45 days in advance of the initial use of the water. Notice must be posted at the site of the diversion or withdrawal, as provided in Article III, section C.3.(c)(ii). Notification to the Department Water Resources Regional Office must provide the following information:

(A) source of water;


(B) legal description of the point of diversion or withdrawal;


(C) place of use;


(D) map showing preceding three items;


(E) purpose of use;


(F) starting and ending date of use;


(G) diversion flow rate;


(H) maximum volume of water to be diverted or withdrawn per day;  and


(I) name and contact information for the contractor and the local Forest Service Ranger District.



(d) the diversion or withdrawal of water for a Dispersed Administrative Use shall not adversely affect a senior Water Right Recognized Under State Law;  and

(e) if notified that the diversion or withdrawal for a Dispersed Administrative Use is adversely affecting a senior Water Right Recognized Under State Law, the Forest Service will immediately cease diversion or withdrawal from that source of supply. To resume the diversion or withdrawal, the Forest Service can move the diversion or withdrawal to another source of supply or satisfy the senior user and the Department Water Resources Regional Office Manager that use will not adversely affect the senior user or users.
D. Change in Use of Federal Reserved Water Rights.1. Discrete Administrative Uses.The United States, without approval of the Department, may change a Discrete Administrative Use described in Article II, section A., provided that:
(a) the purpose of use of the water remains a Discrete Administrative Use as defined in Article I(4) and described in Article II, section A.;

(b) the quantity of water for Discrete Administrative Uses diverted or withdrawn shall not exceed the total amount as set forth in Article II, Table 1;  and

(c) the change shall not adversely affect a Water Right Recognized Under State Law.

Upon request by the Department, the Forest Service shall report to the Department information it has regarding water use for Emergency Fire Suppression, as described in Article II, section C.3. For Dispersed Administrative Uses, as described in Article III, section C.3.(c)(ii) and (iii), upon request by the Department, the Forest Service shall provide copies of notice postings for the stream or basin requested.4. For Dispersed Administrative Uses, as described in Article III, section C.3.(c)(i), upon request by the Department, the Forest Service shall report information it has available. In the event the Department requests additional information for future reports on a stream or basin for enforcement or water distribution purposes, the Forest Service agrees to comply with the request.F. Ownership Interest in Water for Purposes of Statewide Adjudication.The federal reserved water rights for Administrative Uses and Emergency Fire Suppression described in Article II, sections A., B., and C., are ownership interests in water and its use for each water source within National Forest System Lands that has been affected by a temporary preliminary decree or preliminary decree.ARTICLE IVSTATE LAW PROVISIONSA. Compact Principles.In order to promote settlement of issues between the United States and the State, the United States agrees to relinquish any and all claims to federal reserved water rights for instream flows on National Forest System Lands. The State agrees that, in consideration for the United States' agreement not to pursue federal reserved water rights for instream flows on National Forest System Lands, the following principles, subject to the terms of this Compact, shall be included in state law:1. Forest Service Water Rights Recognized Under Law Created in This Compact.There shall be created by this Compact Water Rights Recognized Under State Law held by the Forest Service as set forth in Article V, Table 2.2. State Water Reservation Process.
(a) There shall be a state water reservation process providing a means for the United States to appropriate state-law-based water rights for a minimum instream flow, level, or quality of water that provides an opportunity for hearing and judicial review.

(i) Any appropriation granted under this process will result in a water right held by the United States that is protectable and enforceable under state law, and shall not be subject to periodic review or reallocation.


(ii) The date of appropriation for water rights granted under the state water reservation process will be the date of filing of the application for state water reservations and will be senior in priority to any applications for state water reservations filed after that date.


(b) The Parties agree that the language of 
85-2-316, MCA
, on the Effective Date of This Compact and the terms of Article VI of this Compact satisfy the principles in Article IV, section A.2.
3. New State Water Reservation Section.The United States shall have the right to apply for a state water reservation under a new specific procedure in limited circumstances for state water reservations as set forth in Article VI, section B.4. Standing.In the ongoing statewide adjudication, the United States shall have the right to object to and participate as an objector to any water right claim for water use or storage on or water conveyed across National Forest System Lands. The Parties agree that the language of 
85-2-233, MCA
, on the Effective Date of This Compact satisfies the principles in Article IV, section A.4.B. State Law Adopted as a Condition Precedent to This Compact.Subject to Article VIII, section D., the Parties agree that as a condition precedent to this Compact, the following provisions will be adopted as state law:1. Sequencing.
(a) The permitting process for water appropriations under state law and the permitting for the access and use of National Forest System Lands in relation to water appropriations will be sequenced to avoid conflict between state and federal permitting.

(b) The applicant is required to show proof of federal authorization before the application for a new appropriation of water or a change of appropriation will be correct and complete when:

(i) a state permit is required prior to a new appropriation of water, including ground water, or a change of appropriation;  and


(ii) a federal authorization is required to occupy, use, or traverse National Forest System Lands for the purpose of diversion, impoundment, storage, transportation, withdrawal, use, or distribution of water for the appropriation or change of appropriation.


(c) The state permit for a new appropriation shall be subject to any terms, conditions and limitations related to the use of water contained in the required federal authorization.

(d) The Parties agree that the language of 
85-2-302
, 
85-2-310
, 
85-2-311
, 
85-2-312
, and 
85-2-402, MCA
, on the Effective Date of This Compact satisfies this condition precedent.
2.

B. Priority Date.The priority date of each of the Forest Service Water Rights Recognized Under State Law created in Article V, section A., is the Effective Date of This Compact.C. Purpose of Use.Except for Water Right Number 76M-30023928, the purpose of use of each of the Forest Service Water Rights Recognized Under State Law created in Article V, section A., is fishery. The purpose of use for Water Right Number 76M-30023928, created in Article V, section A., is wildlife, which includes habitat.D. Period of Use.The period of use of each of the Forest Service Water Rights Recognized Under State Law created in Article V, section A., is January 1 to December 31.E. Limitation on Objections to Changes.A Forest Service Water Right Recognized Under State Law created in Article V, section A., shall not be the basis to preclude a change in point of diversion, means of diversion, or place of use of a senior, direct-from-source, stock water right within an allotment on National Forest System Lands if the change is for dispersing stock in the allotment and the proposed change does not expand historic consumptive use of the stock water right.F. Administration and Enforcement.The Forest Service Water Rights Recognized Under State Law created in Article V, section A., are appropriations under state law and, as such, will be administered by the State and enforced in accordance with state law. The United States, as owner and user of these water rights, is entitled to the same benefits and is subject to the same regulations as all other holders of a Water Right Recognized Under State Law.G. Concurrent With Other Instream Flow Uses.The Forest Service Water Rights Recognized Under State Law created in Article V, section A., are for instream uses or in situ nonconsumptive use, meaning that there is no diversion, impoundment, or withdrawal associated with the use and the use does not cause a net loss of water in the source of supply. The Forest Service Water Rights Recognized Under State Law created in Article V, section A., shall run Concurrently with other instream flow or in situ rights.ARTICLE VIAPPLICATIONS FOR STATE WATER RESERVATIONS UNDER STATE LAWA. State Water Reservation.The Forest Service may apply for a state water reservation to maintain a minimum flow, volume, level, or quality of water on National Forest System Lands under 
85-2-316, MCA
, in all basins within the State including basins or subbasins closed to new appropriations on or after the Effective Date of This Compact, subject to the terms of this Compact, for any purpose authorized by federal law applicable to National Forest System Lands. Any purpose authorized by federal law applicable to National Forest System Lands shall be considered a beneficial use under state law for the purposes of this Compact but shall set no precedent as to whether such purposes are beneficial uses under state law outside the terms of this Compact. A state water reservation issued under 
85-2-316, MCA
, is a Water Right Recognized Under State Law.B. Specific Procedure in Limited Circumstances.1. (a) For a state water reservation application pursuant to Article VI, section A., when the purpose of the reservation is to maintain a minimum flow for fish and the amount requested is based on the Wetted Perimeter Methodology or other methodology adopted pursuant to Article VI, section B.1.(b), a correct and complete application shall constitute:
(i) conclusive evidence of the purpose of the reservation;

(ii) conclusive evidence of the need for the reservation;

(iii) prima facie evidence that the amount requested is accurate and suitable:

(A) at the lower inflection point of the Wetted Perimeter Methodology;  or


(B) at the upper inflection point of the Wetted Perimeter Methodology or other methodology adopted pursuant to Article VI, section B.1.(b), when the purpose of the reservation is for an existing population of bull trout, westslope cutthroat trout, Yellowstone cutthroat trout, Columbia River redband trout, arctic grayling, or any other fish species listed in the future under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
16 U.S.C. 1531, et seq.
;  and

(iv) prima facie evidence that the reservation is in the public interest.
(b) By mutual agreement of the Parties, the Department may propose an administrative rule under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, Title 2, chapter 4, of the Montana Code Annotated, to establish a methodology, other than the Wetted Perimeter Methodology, for an application for a state water reservation to maintain a minimum flow under Article VI, section B.1.(a), for fish species identified in Article VI, section B.1.(a)(iii)(B). Rulemaking under this subsection shall not be considered a modification of this Compact. The Department may adopt a rule under this subsection only if it finds, based on scientific and technical evidence in the administrative record, that:

(i) the proposed methodology enjoys acceptance in the scientific community as a methodology for establishment of minimum flow for pertinent fish species based on evidence that includes the existence of peer-reviewed studies, testimony or publications by experts in the field, and previous use in Montana or another relevant location;  and


(ii) the results of the proposed methodology with respect to the stream that is the subject of the application are either based on field data collected with respect to the stream or susceptible to verification based on field data.

2. For purposes of Article VI, section B., a correct and complete application shall be substantially in the form attached to this Compact as Appendix 3. Appendix 3 may be modified at any time by the consent of both Parties and shall not be considered a modification of the Compact.3. For the purposes of Article VI, section B., the Department shall issue a state water reservation unless an objector proves by a preponderance of the evidence that:
(a) the amount of water under the Wetted Perimeter Methodology or other methodology adopted pursuant to Article VI, section B.1.(b), was not accurately measured or calculated, that the Wetted Perimeter Methodology or other methodology adopted pursuant to Article VI, section B.1.(b), could not suitably be applied to the stream reach applied for, or that there is not an existing population of the fish species set forth in Article VI, section B.1.(a)(iii)(B), identified in the application for state water reservation in the stream reach applied for;  or

(b) for the public interest, there is a projected water development project:

(i) that is feasible;


(ii) that is reliably projected to be commenced within ten (10) years or within ten (10) years after a basin closure is removed;


(iii) in which the objector has or can reasonably obtain a possessory interest or the written consent of the Person or Party with the possessory interest in the property where the water is to be diverted, impounded, stored, transported, and put to beneficial use;


(iv) for which the amount of water needed for the project is reasonable;


(v) for which water needed for the project is not reasonably available from any other water source;


(vi) for which the water needed for the project, based on amount and period of use, would be unavailable if the proposed reservation was granted;


(vii) that would not be feasible with water either in a lesser amount or at a different location if the reservation was granted;  and


(viii) that serves a significant public need.

4. If the Department determines that proofs under Article VI, section B.3.(a), are met or that proofs for all criteria under Article VI, section B.3.(b), are met, the Department may issue, modify, or deny the reservation or may subordinate the reservation to the actual development of the project identified in Article VI, section B.3.(b).C. General Provisions.1. The Forest Service's ability to apply for a state water reservation pursuant to Article VI in any basin or subbasin terminates thirty (30) years after the state court issues a final decree for that water basin under 
85-2-234(1), MCA
, or thirty (30) years after the Effective Date of This Compact, whichever is later. The termination of the Forest Service's ability to apply for a state water reservation pursuant to Article VI under this subsection shall not restrict the Forest Service's ability to apply for a water right in any process available to the Forest Service under state law, including 
85-2-316, MCA
, provided that, the terms of this Compact shall not apply.2. A state water reservation issued to the Forest Service under Article VI shall not be the basis to preclude a change in point of diversion, means of diversion, or place of use of a senior, direct-from-source, stock water right within an allotment on National Forest System Lands if the change is for dispersing stock in the allotment and the proposed change does not expand historic consumptive use of the stock water right.3. In any contested case proceeding held under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, Title 2, chapter 4, of the Montana Code Annotated, pursuant to this Compact, the common law and statutory rules of evidence shall apply only upon stipulation of all entities who are involved in a proceeding.4. Any appeal of an administrative decision under Article VI shall be in state court and shall be filed at the First Judicial District in Helena, and the review shall be conducted according to the procedures for judicial review of contested cases under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, Title 2, chapter 4, of the Montana Code Annotated.5. A state water reservation issued to the Forest Service pursuant to Article VI is not subject to periodic review by the Department as set forth in 
85-2-316(10), MCA
. A state water reservation issued to the Forest Service pursuant to Article VI shall not be reallocated to another qualified reservant with a retained priority date as set forth in 
85-2-316(11), MCA
. Unless provided in this Compact, all other provisions of state law apply to a state water reservation issued to the Forest Service.D. Administration and Enforcement.Any state water reservation issued pursuant to Article VI is a Water Right Recognized Under State Law and, as such, will be administered by the State and enforced in accordance with state law. The United States, as owner and user of these water rights, is entitled to the same benefits and is subject to the same regulations of water use as all other holders of a Water Right Recognized Under State Law.E. Concurrent With Other Instream Flow Uses.Any state water reservation issued pursuant to Article VI is a Water Right Recognized Under State Law for instream uses or in situ nonconsumptive uses, meaning that there is no diversion, impoundment, or withdrawal associated with the use and the use does not cause a net loss of water in the source of supply. Unless otherwise provided in the terms and conditions, a state water reservation issued pursuant to Article VI shall run Concurrently with other instream flow rights.F. Department Reporting to Montana Legislature.For the period of time set forth in Article VI, section C.1., the Department shall biennially report to the Environmental Quality Council or other appropriate legislative committee the state water reservations applied for by the Forest Service since the previous report and the Department action on applications for state water reservations by the Forest Service since the previous report.ARTICLE VIIGENERAL PROVISIONSA. No Effect on Tribal Rights or Other Federal Reserved Water Rights.1. The relationship between the water rights of the Forest Service described in this Compact and any rights to water of an Indian tribe in Montana or of any federally derived water right of an individual or of the United States on behalf of such tribe or individual shall be determined by the rule of priority. The Parties to this agreement recognize that the water rights described in This Compact are junior to any tribal water rights with a priority date before the Effective Date of This Compact, including aboriginal rights, if any, in the basins affected.2. Nothing in this Compact may be construed or interpreted in any manner to establish the nature, extent, or manner of administration of the rights to water of any other federal agency or federal lands in Montana other than National Forest System Lands.3. Nothing in this Compact may be construed or interpreted in any manner to establish the nature, extent, or manner of administration of the rights to water of any Indian tribes and tribal members in Montana.4. Nothing in this Compact is otherwise intended to conflict with or abrogate a right or claim of any Indian tribe regarding boundaries or property interests in the State of Montana.B. General Disclaimers.Nothing in this Compact may be construed or interpreted:1. as a precedent for the litigation of federal reserved water rights or the interpretation or administration of future compacts between the United States and the State or between the United States and any other state;2. as a waiver by the United States of its right under state law to raise objections in state court to individual water rights claimed pursuant to state law on National Forest System Land in the basins affected by this Compact or any right to raise objections in an appropriate forum to individual water rights subject to a provisional permit under state law in the basins affected by this Compact;3. to establish a precedent for other agreements between the State and the United States or an Indian tribe;4. to determine the relative rights, inter sese, of Persons using water under the authority of state law or to limit the rights of the Parties or a Person to litigate an issue not resolved by this Compact;5. to create or deny substantive rights through headings or captions used in this Compact;6. to expand or restrict any waiver of sovereign immunity existing pursuant to federal law as of the Effective Date of This Compact;7. with respect to federal reserved water rights, to affect the right of the State to seek fees or reimbursement for costs or the right of the United States to contest the imposition of such fees or costs pursuant to a ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction or Act of Congress;8. to affect in any manner the entitlement to or quantification of other federal water rights. This Compact is only binding on the United States with regard to the water rights of the Forest Service and does not affect the water rights of any other federal agency that is not a successor in interest to the water rights subject to this Compact;9. to prevent the United States from seeking a permit to appropriate water under state law from a source not closed to new permits by law;  or10. to expand or restrict rights of the United States under federal law except as expressly provided in this Compact.C. Reservation of Rights.The Parties expressly reserve all rights not granted, described, or relinquished in this Compact.D. Severability.Except as provided in Article VIII, section C., the provisions of this Compact are not severable.E. Multiple Originals.This Compact is executed in quintuplicate. Each of the five (5) Compacts bearing original signatures shall be deemed an original.F. Notice.Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this Compact, service of notice required under this Compact, except service in litigation, shall be:1. State: Upon the Director of the Department or other officials that the Director may designate in writing.2. United States: Upon the Secretary of Agriculture or other officials that the Secretary may designate in writing.ARTICLE VIIIFINALITY OF COMPACT AND DISMISSAL OF CLAIMSA. Binding Effect.1. The Effective Date of This Compact is the date of the ratification of this Compact by the Montana Legislature, written approval by the United States Department of Agriculture, or written approval by the United States Department of Justice, whichever occurs later. Subject to Article VIII, section C., once effective, all of the provisions of this Compact shall be binding on:
(a) the State and a Person or entity of any nature whatsoever using, claiming, or in any manner asserting a right under the authority of the State to the use of water;  and

(b) except as otherwise provided in Article VII, section A., the United States and a Person or entity of any nature whatsoever using, claiming, or in any manner asserting a right under the authority of the United States to the use of water.
2. Following the Effective Date of This Compact, this Compact shall not be modified without the consent of both Parties. Unilateral substantive modification of the terms of this Compact by either Party, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall render this Compact voidable at the election of the other Party.3. On approval of this Compact by a court of competent jurisdiction and entry of a decree by such court confirming the rights described in this Compact, this Compact and such rights are binding on all Persons bound by the final order of the court.4. If an objection to this Compact is sustained under 
85-2-233, MCA
, this Compact shall be voidable by action of and without prejudice to either Party.B. Enforcement of Compact.1. Either Party may seek enforcement of the terms of this Compact in a court of competent jurisdiction, subject to the limitations of remedies provided in Article VIII, section C.2. When the enforcement action involves issues of notice or reporting required under Article III, sections C.3.(c) and E., the State shall provide written notice to the Forest Service and allow a reasonable opportunity to resolve the issue prior to filing an enforcement action.3. Except as provided in Article VIII, section C., the remedy for an action for enforcement of the terms of this Compact shall not include termination of the Compact in whole or in part.C. Exclusive Remedy for Changes in State Law.1. For the time period set forth in subsection 11, if the State enacts a law that results in an alleged material impairment of any principle set forth in Article IV, section A.2., A.3., or A.4., the United States may, within 90 days of the effective date of the law, provide notice to the State of the alleged material impairment. If the United States fails to provide notice within 90 days of the effective date of the law, the United States is barred from taking any action under this section regarding alleged material impairment by enactment of the law.2. Following the receipt of notice provided in subsection 1, the Parties shall meet within 30 days to discuss the alleged material impairment. The Parties may each appoint a negotiator and may utilize a neutral third party to discuss resolution of the alleged material impairment.3. If the State does not agree that the legislation has resulted in material impairment within 90 days or such time as the Parties may agree or if no other alternative resolution has been found, the United States may seek a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction declaring that the specified act of the Montana Legislature has resulted in material impairment of a principle set forth in Article IV, section A.2., A.3., or A.4. The only remedy available under this subsection is a declaratory judgment as to whether or not the change in state law results in a material impairment of a principle set for in Article IV, section A.2., A.3., or A.4. The Parties shall jointly request the court to retain jurisdiction through all proceedings under this section.4. If the State agrees or if a court finds that changes to state law have materially impaired a principle set forth in Article IV, section A.2., A.3., or A.4., the United States may take no action under subsection 5 until the final adjournment of the next regular session of the Montana Legislature. If the material impairment is cured through enacted legislation to the satisfaction of the United States, the United States is barred from taking further action under this section.5. If, in the opinion of the United States, the State has failed to enact legislation that cures a material impairment as provided in subsection 4, the United States may initiate severance and termination of portions of the Compact as provided in subsection 8 by sending notice to the State within 90 days from the end of the regularly scheduled legislative session. If this notice is not served within the 90-day period, the United States is barred from severing and terminating portions of the Compact based on material impairment.6. If the State has enacted a law to cure the material impairment and the United States does not agree that the material impairment has been cured by the enactment, the State shall have the opportunity within 90 days from receipt of the notice served by the United States to seek a judgment declaring that the specific enactment has cured the material impairment of a principle set forth in Article IV, section A.2., A.3., or A.4., either by:
(a) invoking any retained jurisdiction of the court;  or

(b) if no court has retained jurisdiction over the dispute, seeking a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction.
7. If the State does not file an action within the 90-day period provided in subsection 6, the notice served by the United States becomes effective at the expiration of the 90-day period. If the State files for declaratory judgment and the court finds that legislation enacted by the State cures the material impairment, then the notice served by the United States does not operate to sever or terminate portions of the Compact under subsection 8. If the court finds that the enacted legislation does not cure the material impairment, the notice served by the United States becomes effective when the court's judgment becomes final either through the exhaustion of all available appeals or the running of the time for taking an appeal.8. If the United States elects to sever and terminate portions of the Compact under this section, the Parties agree that Article IV, section A.2., A.3., and A.4., and Article VI together and in their entirety are severed from the Compact and all rights and obligations under those provisions are terminated. All other provisions of this Compact remain in force and effect. If the portions of the Compact are severed and terminated, the Parties agree that the United States shall retain all water rights contained in Articles II and V and state water reservations granted to the United States prior to severance and termination under this subsection.9. If the United States severs and terminates portions of the Compact as provided in subsection 8, the United States may file federal reserved water right claims in the state general stream adjudication, in the Montana Water Court or other state court that succeeds to the Montana Water Court's jurisdiction to conduct the general stream adjudication, for instream flow for any stream on which the United States has not been granted a Water Right Recognized Under State Law for an instream flow or an in situ right. The United States shall file all federal reserved water right claims for instream flow with the state court within twelve (12) months after severance and termination of portions of the Compact become effective. The United States agrees that, regardless of the dates of the reservation of the National Forest System Lands for which a federal reserved water right is claimed, the priority date of the federal reserved water right claim will be the Effective Date of This Compact.10. The remedy provided in Article VIII, section C., is the exclusive remedy for actions brought as a result of changes to state law that materially impair the provisions of Article IV, section A.2., A.3., or A.4. There is no remedy under this Compact for changes to state law except as applied under this section to Article IV, section A.2., A.3., and A.4., and as provided in Article VIII, section A.2.11. This section and the procedure and remedy provided under this section shall remain in effect for a period of thirty (30) years after the state court issues a final decree for all water basins under 
85-2-234(1), MCA
, that contain National Forest System Lands. This period of time under this subsection is tolled for any period of time during which state law materially impaired the interest of the United States as agreed to by the State or determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. After this period, all rights and remedies under this section terminate.

;  and



(A) at the lower inflection point of the Wetted Perimeter Methodology;  or


(B) at the upper inflection point of the Wetted Perimeter Methodology or other methodology adopted pursuant to Article VI, section B.1.(b), when the purpose of the reservation is for an existing population of bull trout, westslope cutthroat trout, Yellowstone cutthroat trout, Columbia River redband trout, arctic grayling, or any other fish species listed in the future under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, 
16 U.S.C. 1531, et seq.
;  and

(iv) prima facie evidence that the reservation is in the public interest.
(b) By mutual agreement of the Parties, the Department may propose an administrative rule under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, Title 2, chapter 4, of the Montana Code Annotated, to establish a methodology, other than the Wetted Perimeter Methodology, for an application for a state water reservation to maintain a minimum flow under Article VI, section B.1.(a), for fish species identified in Article VI, section B.1.(a)(iii)(B). Rulemaking under this subsection shall not be considered a modification of this Compact. The Department may adopt a rule under this subsection only if it finds, based on scientific and technical evidence in the administrative record, that:

(i) the proposed methodology enjoys acceptance in the scientific community as a methodology for establishment of minimum flow for pertinent fish species based on evidence that includes the existence of peer-reviewed studies, testimony or publications by experts in the field, and previous use in Montana or another relevant location;  and

Appendix 3 may be modified at any time by the consent of both Parties and shall not be considered a modification of the Compact.3. For the purposes of Article VI, section B., the Department shall issue a state water reservation unless an objector proves by a preponderance of the evidence that:
(a) the amount of water under the Wetted Perimeter Methodology or other methodology adopted pursuant to Article VI, section B.1.(b), was not accurately measured or calculated, that the Wetted Perimeter Methodology or other methodology adopted pursuant to Article VI, section B.1.(b), could not suitably be applied to the stream reach applied for, or that there is not an existing population of the fish species set forth in Article VI, section B.1.(a)(iii)(B), identified in the application for state water reservation in the stream reach applied for;  or

(b) for the public interest, there is a projected water development project:

(i) that is feasible;


(ii) that is reliably projected to be commenced within ten (10) years or within ten (10) years after a basin closure is removed;


(iii) in which the objector has or can reasonably obtain a possessory interest or the written consent of the Person or Party with the possessory interest in the property where the water is to be diverted, impounded, stored, transported, and put to beneficial use;


(iv) for which the amount of water needed for the project is reasonable;


(v) for which water needed for the project is not reasonably available from any other water source;


(vi) for which the water needed for the project, based on amount and period of use, would be unavailable if the proposed reservation was granted;


(vii) that would not be feasible with water either in a lesser amount or at a different location if the reservation was granted;  and


(viii) that serves a significant public need.

4. If the Department determines that proofs under Article VI, section B.3.(a), are met or that proofs for all criteria under Article VI, section B.3.(b), are met, the Department may issue, modify, or deny the reservation or may subordinate the reservation to the actual development of the project identified in Article VI, section B.3.(b).C. General Provisions.1. The Forest Service's ability to apply for a state water reservation pursuant to Article VI in any basin or subbasin terminates thirty (30) years after the state court issues a final decree for that water basin under 
85-2-234(1), MCA
, or thirty (30) years after the Effective Date of This Compact, whichever is later. The termination of the Forest Service's ability to apply for a state water reservation pursuant to Article VI under this subsection shall not restrict the Forest Service's ability to apply for a water right in any process available to the Forest Service under state law, including 
85-2-316, MCA
, provided that, the terms of this Compact shall not apply.2. A state water reservation issued to the Forest Service under Article VI shall not be the basis to preclude a change in point of diversion, means of diversion, or place of use of a senior, direct-from-source, stock water right within an allotment on National Forest System Lands if the change is for dispersing stock in the allotment and the proposed change does not expand historic consumptive use of the stock water right.3. In any contested case proceeding held under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, Title 2, chapter 4, of the Montana Code Annotated, pursuant to this Compact, the common law and statutory rules of evidence shall apply only upon stipulation of all entities who are involved in a proceeding.4. Any appeal of an administrative decision under Article VI shall be in state court and shall be filed at the First Judicial District in Helena, and the review shall be conducted according to the procedures for judicial review of contested cases under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, Title 2, chapter 4, of the Montana Code Annotated.5. A state water reservation issued to the Forest Service pursuant to Article VI is not subject to periodic review by the Department as set forth in 
85-2-316(10), MCA
. A state water reservation issued to the Forest Service pursuant to Article VI shall not be reallocated to another qualified reservant with a retained priority date as set forth in 
85-2-316(11), MCA
. Unless provided in this Compact, all other provisions of state law apply to a state water reservation issued to the Forest Service.D. Administration and Enforcement.Any state water reservation issued pursuant to Article VI is a Water Right Recognized Under State Law and, as such, will be administered by the State and enforced in accordance with state law. The United States, as owner and user of these water rights, is entitled to the same benefits and is subject to the same regulations of water use as all other holders of a Water Right Recognized Under State Law.E. Concurrent With Other Instream Flow Uses.Any state water reservation issued pursuant to Article VI is a Water Right Recognized Under State Law for instream uses or in situ nonconsumptive uses, meaning that there is no diversion, impoundment, or withdrawal associated with the use and the use does not cause a net loss of water in the source of supply. Unless otherwise provided in the terms and conditions, a state water reservation issued pursuant to Article VI shall run Concurrently with other instream flow rights.F. Department Reporting to Montana Legislature.For the period of time set forth in Article VI, section C.1., the Department shall biennially report to the Environmental Quality Council or other appropriate legislative committee the state water reservations applied for by the Forest Service since the previous report and the Department action on applications for state water reservations by the Forest Service since the previous report.ARTICLE VIIGENERAL PROVISIONSA. No Effect on Tribal Rights or Other Federal Reserved Water Rights.1. The relationship between the water rights of the Forest Service described in this Compact and any rights to water of an Indian tribe in Montana or of any federally derived water right of an individual or of the United States on behalf of such tribe or individual shall be determined by the rule of priority. The Parties to this agreement recognize that the water rights described in This Compact are junior to any tribal water rights with a priority date before the Effective Date of This Compact, including aboriginal rights, if any, in the basins affected.2. Nothing in this Compact may be construed or interpreted in any manner to establish the nature, extent, or manner of administration of the rights to water of any other federal agency or federal lands in Montana other than National Forest System Lands.3. Nothing in this Compact may be construed or interpreted in any manner to establish the nature, extent, or manner of administration of the rights to water of any Indian tribes and tribal members in Montana.4. Nothing in this Compact is otherwise intended to conflict with or abrogate a right or claim of any Indian tribe regarding boundaries or property interests in the State of Montana.B. General Disclaimers.Nothing in this Compact may be construed or interpreted:1. as a precedent for the litigation of federal reserved water rights or the interpretation or administration of future compacts between the United States and the State or between the United States and any other state;2. as a waiver by the United States of its right under state law to raise objections in state court to individual water rights claimed pursuant to state law on National Forest System Land in the basins affected by this Compact or any right to raise objections in an appropriate forum to individual water rights subject to a provisional permit under state law in the basins affected by this Compact;3. to establish a precedent for other agreements between the State and the United States or an Indian tribe;4. to determine the relative rights, inter sese, of Persons using water under the authority of state law or to limit the rights of the Parties or a Person to litigate an issue not resolved by this Compact;5. to create or deny substantive rights through headings or captions used in this Compact;6. to expand or restrict any waiver of sovereign immunity existing pursuant to federal law as of the Effective Date of This Compact;7. with respect to federal reserved water rights, to affect the right of the State to seek fees or reimbursement for costs or the right of the United States to contest the imposition of such fees or costs pursuant to a ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction or Act of Congress;8. to affect in any manner the entitlement to or quantification of other federal water rights. This Compact is only binding on the United States with regard to the water rights of the Forest Service and does not affect the water rights of any other federal agency that is not a successor in interest to the water rights subject to this Compact;9. to prevent the United States from seeking a permit to appropriate water under state law from a source not closed to new permits by law;  or10. to expand or restrict rights of the United States under federal law except as expressly provided in this Compact.C.

When the enforcement action involves issues of notice or reporting required under Article III, sections C.3.(c) and E., the State shall provide written notice to the Forest Service and allow a reasonable opportunity to resolve the issue prior to filing an enforcement action.3. Except as provided in Article VIII, section C., the remedy for an action for enforcement of the terms of this Compact shall not include termination of the Compact in whole or in part.C. Exclusive Remedy for Changes in State Law.1. For the time period set forth in subsection 11, if the State enacts a law that results in an alleged material impairment of any principle set forth in Article IV, section A.2., A.3., or A.4., the United States may, within 90 days of the effective date of the law, provide notice to the State of the alleged material impairment. If the United States fails to provide notice within 90 days of the effective date of the law, the United States is barred from taking any action under this section regarding alleged material impairment by enactment of the law.2. Following the receipt of notice provided in subsection 1, the Parties shall meet within 30 days to discuss the alleged material impairment. The Parties may each appoint a negotiator and may utilize a neutral third party to discuss resolution of the alleged material impairment.3. If the State does not agree that the legislation has resulted in material impairment within 90 days or such time as the Parties may agree or if no other alternative resolution has been found, the United States may seek a judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction declaring that the specified act of the Montana Legislature has resulted in material impairment of a principle set forth in Article IV, section A.2., A.3., or A.4. The only remedy available under this subsection is a declaratory judgment as to whether or not the change in state law results in a material impairment of a principle set for in Article IV, section A.2., A.3., or A.4. The Parties shall jointly request the court to retain jurisdiction through all proceedings under this section.4. If the State agrees or if a court finds that changes to state law have materially impaired a principle set forth in Article IV, section A.2., A.3., or A.4., the United States may take no action under subsection 5 until the final adjournment of the next regular session of the Montana Legislature. If the material impairment is cured through enacted legislation to the satisfaction of the United States, the United States is barred from taking further action under this section.5. If, in the opinion of the United States, the State has failed to enact legislation that cures a material impairment as provided in subsection 4, the United States may initiate severance and termination of portions of the Compact as provided in subsection 8 by sending notice to the State within 90 days from the end of the regularly scheduled legislative session. If this notice is not served within the 90-day period, the United States is barred from severing and terminating portions of the Compact based on material impairment.6. If the State has enacted a law to cure the material impairment and the United States does not agree that the material impairment has been cured by the enactment, the State shall have the opportunity within 90 days from receipt of the notice served by the United States to seek a judgment declaring that the specific enactment has cured the material impairment of a principle set forth in Article IV, section A.2., A.3., or A.4., either by:
(a) invoking any retained jurisdiction of the court;  or

ARTICLE III


TRIBAL WATER RIGHT


A. General Statement of the Tribal Water Right. The Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation have the right to divert annually from the Missouri River, certain of its tributaries, and ground water beneath the Reservation the lesser of (i) 1,050,472 acre-feet of water, or (ii) the quantity of water necessary to supply a consumptive use of 525,236 acre-feet per year for the uses and purposes set forth in this Compact with a priority date of May 1, 1888, provided that no more than 950,000 acre-feet of water, or the quantity of water necessary to supply a consumptive use of 475,000 acre-feet may be diverted annually from surface water sources. This right is held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Tribes and is further defined and limited as set forth in this Compact.


B. Persons Who May Use the Tribal Water Right. All uses of water authorized under any applicable law by the following persons shall be considered and calculated as uses of the Tribal Water Right:

1. the Tribes within or outside the Reservation;


2. all individual Indians using water within the Reservation including, but not limited to, Indians exercising uses established pursuant to state law prior to the effective date of this Compact;


3. all non-Indian successors-in-interest to any allottee actually using water within the Reservation by virtue of a water right arising under the laws of the United States, which water right was acquired directly or indirectly from an Indian predecessor-in-interest;


4. all other persons receiving water from the Fort Peck Irrigation Project including, but not limited to, persons exercising uses established pursuant to state law prior to the effective date of this Compact;


5. all other persons authorized to use water by the Tribes pursuant to this Compact, within or outside the Reservation;


6. the United States as trustee for the Tribes or any Indian including, but not limited to, persons exercising uses established pursuant to state law prior to the effective date of this Compact.



C. Measure of Consumptive Use for Irrigation. Irrigation usage of the Tribal Water Right shall be conclusively deemed to cause a consumptive use of 1.8 acre-feet per acre per year for full service irrigation and 0.48 acre-feet per acre per year for partial service irrigation. Any loss of water due to evaporation from reservoirs constructed in the future for conservation (carry-over) storage rather than for regulatory storage by the United States for the benefit of the Tribes or any Indian, or constructed for such conservation storage by the Tribes or by any Indian, shall be counted as a consumptive use.


D. Purposes for Which the Tribal Water Right May be Used. Within the Reservation, use of water in the exercise of the Tribal Water Right for any purpose may be authorized by the Tribes without regard to whether such use is beneficial as defined by valid state law. No use of the Tribal Water Right may be wasteful or inconsistent with the terms of this Compact. Outside the Reservation, any use of water in the exercise of the Tribal Water Right shall be beneficial as defined by valid state law on the date the Tribes give notice to the State of a proposed use outside the Reservation.


E. Facilities Diverting or Using the Tribal Water Right Outside the Reservation. All persons diverting or using the Tribal Water Right outside the Reservation, including the Tribes as sovereign, shall apply for all permits, certificates, variances and other authorizations required by valid state laws regulating, conditioning or permitting the siting, construction, operation, alteration or use of any equipment, device, facility or associated facility proposed to use or transport water located outside the Reservation, and shall comply with all applicable provisions of this Compact. A diversion or use of water in the exercise of the Tribal Water Right may be made only after all permits, certificates, variances or other authorizations applied for pursuant to this paragraph have been obtained, and the diversion or use has not been found unlawful by a court of competent jurisdiction.


F. Amounts To Be Diverted from the Missouri River.

1. Diversions of water for use within or outside the Reservation may be made in the exercise of the Tribal Water Right from Fort Peck Reservoir and the mainstem of the Missouri River--but without utilization of the conservation (carry-over) storage of Fort Peck Reservoir--in the following amounts:

(a) during the months of November, December, January, February and March, not to exceed 40,000 acre-feet per month;


(b) during the months of April and October, not to exceed 50,000 acre-feet per month;


(c) during the months of May and September, not to exceed 105,000 acre-feet per month;


(d) during the month of June, not to exceed 145,000 acre-feet;


(e) during the month of July, not to exceed 215,000 acre-feet;


(f) during the month of August, not to exceed 180,000 acre-feet.


Provided that the aggregate of monthly diversions in the exercise of the Tribal Water Right from surface water shall not exceed 950,000 acre-feet per year, and the total annual consumptive use shall not exceed 475,000 acre-feet.

2. The Tribes shall report the amount of all actual diversions from Fort Peck Reservoir and the mainstem of the Missouri River to the United States Army Corps of Engineers by April 1st of the calendar year following the year in which such diversions are made in accordance with paragraph 5 of section J of this Article.


3. All diversions authorized by paragraph 1 of this section may be made without payment to the United States, but the Tribes and any user of the Tribal Water Right shall otherwise comply with all generally applicable laws and regulations of the United States.



G. Export of the Tribal Water Right Outside the State. Use of the Tribal Water Right outside the State shall be in compliance with all valid provisions of state law in effect at the time of the proposed transfer that prohibit, regulate, condition, or permit the transportation of water outside the State.


H. Non-use of the Tribal Water Right not a Forfeiture. Non-use of any part of the Tribal Water Right shall not constitute a relinquishment, forfeiture or abandonment of the right to such use.


I. Sources of Diversions of the Tribal Water Right. In the exercise of the Tribal Water Right water may be diverted:

1. Within the Reservation for use within the Reservation from:

(a) the mainstem of the Missouri River within or adjacent to the Reservation;


(b) any tributary of the Missouri River that flows through or adjacent to the Reservation, except the mainstem of the Milk River;  and


(c) any ground water source.



2. Outside the Reservation for use within the Reservation from:

(a) Fort Peck Reservoir;


(b) any tributary of the Missouri River that flows through or adjacent to the Reservation, except the mainstem of the Milk River;  and


(c) the mainstem of the Missouri River below Fort Peck Dam.

Diversions authorized by subparagraphs (a) and (c) shall comply with paragraph 1 of section J of this Article.


3. Within or outside the Reservation for use outside the Reservation from:

(a) Fort Peck Reservoir;


(b) any tributary of the Missouri River that flows through or adjacent to the Reservation, except the mainstem of the Milk River, provided that water from these sources shall not be transported outside the respective watershed of each stream;

(d) the mainstem of the Missouri River above Fort Peck Reservoir.

Diversions authorized by subparagraphs (a) and (c) shall comply with paragraph 1 of section J of this Article. Diversions authorized by subparagraph (b) shall comply with paragraph 4 of section K of this Article. Diversions authorized by subparagraph (d) shall comply with paragraph 3 of section J of this Article.



J. Notice of and Conditions upon Diversions and Uses of the Tribal Water Right.

1. The Tribes shall give the State not less than 180 days advance written notice of any proposed diversion or use of the Tribal Water Right authorized by subparagraphs 2(a) and 2(c) and subparagraphs 3(a) and 3(c) of section I of this Article and shall, in the case of any transfer of the Tribal Water Right, except agreements on the tributaries pursuant to paragraph 4 of section K of this Article, offer the State an opportunity to participate as provided in paragraph 2 of section K of this Article. Such notice shall include sufficient documentation to demonstrate that:

(a) the proposed use of water complies with section D of this Article;


(b) for diversions outside the Reservation, the proposed means of diversion and the construction and operation of the diversion works are adequate;


(c) the proposed use and diversion will not adversely affect, except with the consent of the owner of such right, any of the following rights to the use of water existing at that time:

(i) any water right arising under the laws of the United States;


(ii) any appropriative right to the use of water established pursuant to the laws of the State that has not been abandoned, but excluding any reservation of water made pursuant to the laws of the State which has not been put to actual beneficial use by the date notice is given;



(d) the proposed use does not cause any unreasonable significant adverse environmental impact;  and


(e) proposed diversions in excess of 4,000 acre-feet per year and 5.5 cubic feet per second of water will not:

(i) substantially impair the quality of water for existing uses in the source of water from which the diversion is made;


(ii) be made where low quality water which can economically be used is legally and physically available to the Tribes for the proposed use;


(iii) create or substantially contribute to saline seep;  or


(iv) substantially injure fish or wildlife populations in the source of water from which the diversion is made.


The requirements of subparagraph (c) of this paragraph may be satisfied by a showing that the owner of such right has consented to the adverse effect. Subparagraph (c) shall not be construed to alter or avoid in any way the consequences resulting from such consent under state law.


2. A proposed diversion or use of the Tribal Water Right outside the Reservation authorized by subparagraphs 2(a) and 2(c) and subparagraphs 3(a) and 3(c) of section I of this Article may be challenged only:

In any such case, the Tribes shall have the burden of going forward and the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that they have satisfied the requirements of paragraph 1 of this section.


3. Diversions of water in the exercise of the Tribal Water Right outside the Reservation from the mainstem of the Missouri River above Fort Peck Reservoir, as authorized in subparagraph 3(d) of section I of this Article, may be made so long as the Tribes or any user of the Tribal Water Right:

(a) comply with all the laws of the State in effect at the time the diversion is proposed, including but not limited to state water use statutes;


(b) give not less than 180 days advance written notice of any proposed diversion in the manner required in paragraph 5 of this section:

(i) if the diversion is to be made from a reservoir, to the operator of the reservoir;  or


(ii) if the diversion is not to be made from a reservoir, to the operator of the first dam, upstream and downstream, if any, from the point of diversion;



(c) obtain approval of the diversion from the State legislature.



4. For purposes of demonstrating compliance with subparagraph 1(c) and subparagraph 3(a) of this section and paragraph 6 of Section K of this Article, the portion of the Tribal Water Right to be diverted will be deemed an appropriative right which has:

(a) been acquired on May 1, 1888;


(b) a point of diversion and use where the water is actually being diverted and used or, if not actually being diverted, where the water would first flow on or adjacent to the Reservation;


(c) the existing use or, if not actually in use, an irrigation use provided, however, that the use can be transferred to a purpose other than irrigation without restriction as to period of use so long as the requirements of Section F of this Article are observed;


(d) the actual consumptive use or, if not actually in use or if being used for irrigation purposes, a consumptive use of 1.8 acre-feet per acre per year;  and

K. Transfers of the Tribal Water Right.

1. As an incident to and in the exercise of the Tribal Water Right, the Tribes may transfer within or outside the Reservation, as authorized by federal law and this Compact, the right to use water but may not permanently alienate such right or any part thereof. Any such transfer of water by the Tribes shall be subject to all provisions of this Compact.


2. Prior to making any transfer which authorizes use of water outside the Reservation to be diverted from the mainstem of the Missouri River, including Fort Peck Reservoir, the Tribes shall give not less than 180 days advance written notice to the State of the proposed terms and conditions of the transfer, and shall offer the State the opportunity to participate in the transfer as a substantially equal partner with the Tribes, assuming obligations and receiving benefits of the transfer under terms and conditions agreed to by the Parties. If the State does not accept the opportunity within the 180-day notice period, or if the State unreasonably delays the institution or completion of approval processes required by state law or unreasonably delays resolution of any litigation arising from its decision to accept the opportunity, the Tribes may proceed with the proposed transfer without State participation, provided that the proposed transfer shall be subject to all other provisions of this Compact. If the State does not accept the opportunity, or if State participation in the joint transfer is not approved, the State shall not later pursue the opportunity, except in accordance with all the terms of this Compact, including paragraph 3 of this section.


3. Prior to making any transfer allowing use or diversion of water from Fort Peck Reservoir or from the mainstem of the Missouri River below Fort Peck Dam, the State shall give not less than 180 days advance written notice to the Tribes of the proposed terms and conditions of the transfer and shall offer the Tribes the same opportunity to participate in the transfer as a substantially equal partner with the State, assuming obligations and receiving benefits of the transfer on terms and conditions agreed to by the Parties. If the Tribes do not accept the opportunity within the 180 day notice period, the State may proceed with the proposed transfer without the Tribes' participation, and the Tribes shall not later pursue the opportunity except in accordance with all the terms of this Compact, including paragraph 2 of this section.


4. If otherwise authorized by federal law, the Tribes may enter into an agreement with any person who is exercising or proposing to exercise a right under the laws of the State to use surface water outside the Reservation on any tributary of the Missouri River that flows through or adjacent to the Reservation, except the mainstem of the Milk River, which agreement allows such person's diversion and use and protects it from any other exercise of the Tribal Water Right provided, however, that:

(a) before use of such water, the person shall have complied with all applicable state laws concerning the acquisition of a water right;


(b) subsequent to acquisition of the state water right, regulation of its use shall be subject to state law;


(c) the amount of water subject to the agreement shall be considered a consumptive use of the Tribal Water Right;


(d) the agreement shall not permanently alienate the Tribal Water Right or any part thereof.



5. The Tribes may transfer annually only the following amounts of water for consumptive use outside the Reservation:

(a) 50,000 acre-feet;


(b) plus 35 percent of any amount over 200,000 acre-feet but less than 300,000 acre-feet authorized by state law to be transferred annually by the State from waters within the State;


(c) plus 50 percent of any amount over 300,000 acre-feet authorized by state law to be transferred annually by the State from waters within the State.

Transfers of the Tribal Water Right shall not be considered as part of any amounts authorized by state law to be transferred annually by the State.


6. In no event shall the Tribes be authorized to transfer less than 50,000 acre-feet of water per year outside the Reservation. The limits established in paragraph 5 of this section shall apply so long as the State is authorized to transfer annually at least 50,000 acre-feet of water pursuant to state law. If statutory authorization for the State to transfer water is not enacted, is repealed, or is held invalid, or if the amount of water authorized by state law to be transferred by the State is less than 50,000 acre-feet per year, then for any period in which the authorization or the limitation is not in force the Tribes may transfer water in accordance with all terms and conditions of this Compact other than paragraph 5 of this section. However, such transfers will be subject to any volume limitations provided by federal law or, in the absence of any federal volume limitations, the Tribes may transfer water in accordance with all terms and conditions in this Compact other than paragraph 5 of this section and with any volume limitations imposed by state law which would apply to a holder of a right to the use of water established pursuant to state law. For the purposes of complying with volume limitations imposed by state law, the Tribal Water Right will be deemed to have the characteristics set forth in paragraph 4 of section J of this Article.


7. Unless authorized by federal law, the State shall not in any manner whatsoever tax any proceeds received by the Tribes as consideration for any transfer of the Tribal Water Right.



L. Instream Flows.

1. At any time within five years after the effective date of this Compact, the Tribes may establish a schedule of instream flows to maintain any fish or wildlife resource in those portions of streams, excluding the mainstem of the Milk River, which are tributaries of the Missouri River that flow through or adjacent to the Reservation. These instream flows shall be a part of the Tribal Water Right with a priority date of May 1, 1888. Water remaining in a stream to maintain instream flows pursuant to such a schedule shall be counted by the Tribes as a consumptive use of surface water.


2. Instream flows may be established by the Tribes only in accordance with this section. The Tribes may change the use of water for maintenance of instream flows to another purpose only with the consent of the State.



M. No Other Diversion or Use of the Tribal Water Right. No other diversion or use of the Tribal Water Right shall be made other than those authorized or recognized by this Article.

ARTICLE IV


PROTECTION OF USES UNDER STATE LAW



A. Uses Protected.

1. The following existing and proposed uses of water by Indians within the Reservation are protected and shall not be subordinated to any other uses by subsequent provisions of this Article:

3. With the exception of the uses protected in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section, diversion and use of water in the exercise of the Tribal Water Right except from the mainstem of the Missouri River, including water allocated to instream flow purposes, shall be subordinate to the following uses of water in the Porcupine Creek, Poplar River, Big Muddy Creek, Little Porcupine Creek, Wolf Creek, Tule Creek, and Chelsea Creek watersheds, including all tributary streams within those watersheds, and all underlying ground water whether or not hydrologically connected with the surface water:

(a) the beneficial uses of water with a priority date of December 31, 1984 or earlier established under the laws of the State and identified in Appendix A to this Compact;

B. Changes of Protected Uses.

1. The rights to the use of water protected by paragraph 3 of section A of this Article may be changed in accordance with state law as to point of diversion, period of use, place of use, purpose of use, or ownership of the right provided that:

2. Upon receiving an application for a proposed change authorized by paragraph 1 of this section, the State shall give the Tribes such advance written notice as is required by state law.


3. If an irrigation use is changed in any manner, or if a reservoir is constructed or operated which results in the consumptive use of water by evaporation, the following limitations apply:

(a) no more than 1.8 acre-feet of consumptive use per year may be authorized for each acre of land retired from full service irrigation;  and


(b) no more than 0.48 acre-feet of consumptive use per year may be authorized for each acre of land retired from partial service irrigation;


(c) evaporation from any reservoir shall be charged as a consumptive use in accordance with definition 4 in Article II.

The owner shall also have the quality of the return flows sampled and tested by a laboratory acceptable to the State and the Tribes as often as reasonably required by the State and the Tribes and at the expense of the owner.


ARTICLE V


ADMINISTRATION OF WATER RIGHTS



A. United States Administration. All rights to the use of water received from the Fort Peck Irrigation Project shall be administered by the United States, and the United States has the final and exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes concerning uses of water received from the Fort Peck Irrigation Project subject to any judicial review provided by applicable law.


B. Tribal Administration.

1. The Tribal Water Right shall be administered by the Tribes, and the Tribes have the final and exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes between users of the Tribal Water Right, except for disputes concerning uses of water received from the Fort Peck Irrigation Project and disputes involving users of the Tribal Water Right pursuant to agreements authorized in Article III, section K, paragraph 4.


2. Administration and enforcement of the Tribal Water Right shall be pursuant to a water code, which shall be adopted by the Tribes and submitted for approval to the Secretary of the Interior within one year after ratification of this Compact by the Parties. Such code shall take effect 18 months after ratification of this Compact unless sooner disapproved by the Secretary of the Interior. Pending the adoption and approval of the tribal water code, administration and enforcement of the Tribal Water Right shall be by the Secretary of the Interior as trustee for the Tribes. The Tribes shall not administer the Tribal Water Right in a manner which denies any person a water right owned by that person which arises under the laws of the United States.


3. Within six months after the tribal water code takes effect or within six months after disapproval of the code by the Secretary, the Tribes or the Secretary of the Interior shall provide the State with notice of each existing use of the Tribal Water Right which shall show:

(a) the person authorized to make the diversion;


(b) the amount of water authorized to be diverted annually;


(c) the amount of water authorized for annual consumptive use;


(d) the point of diversion;


(e) the period of use;


(f) the place of use;


(g) the uses for which the water may be diverted;  and


(h) the relative priority of the use as against other uses of the Tribal Water Right.



4. The Tribes shall thereafter notify the State within sixty days after the end of each quarter year of all new uses of surface and ground water authorized by the Tribes during the preceding quarter year and of all new uses of the Tribal Water Right actually commenced during that quarter year.



C. State Administration.

1. The State shall administer all rights to the use of surface water and ground water within or outside the Reservation which are not a part of the Tribal Water Right to the fullest extent allowed by law. The State shall have the final and exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes between users of rights established under state law.


2. Within two years after ratification of this Compact, the State shall notify the Tribes of all existing uses authorized by the State on the mainstem of the Missouri River below Fort Peck Dam and on all tributaries of the Missouri River that flow through or adjacent to the Reservation, except the mainstem of the Milk River. The State shall notify the Tribes within sixty days after the end of each quarter year of all new uses of surface and ground water permitted by the State on each of these sources during the preceding quarter year and of all new uses of water actually commenced pursuant to the laws of the State during that quarter year on each of these sources. Notices required by this paragraph shall include the information required by paragraph 3 of section B of this Article.


3. No agency of the State shall administer any part of the Tribal Water Right. From and after the effective date of this Compact, unless the Tribal Water Right confirmed in Article III is fully utilized at the time application is made for a permit or other authorization, the State shall issue no permit or other authorization to divert or use water within the Reservation to the following persons:

(a) the Tribes;


(b) any Indian;


(c) any non-Indian successor-in-interest to any allottee on the Reservation by virtue of that person's assertion of a right arising under the laws of the United States;  or


(d) the United States for the benefit of the Tribes or any Indian or any non-Indian successor-in-interest to any allottee.




D. Regulation of Ground Water.

2. With the exception of uses protected in Article IV, the State shall not, without the Tribes' consent, authorize or continue the use of ground water that unreasonably interferes with a use of ground water authorized by the Tribes. The Tribes shall not, without the consent of the State, authorize or continue the use of ground water that unreasonably interferes with a use of ground water authorized by the State and protected by Article IV of this Compact.


ARTICLE VI


FORT PECK-MONTANA COMPACT BOARD



A. Board established. There is hereby established the Fort Peck-Montana Compact Board, which shall exercise powers and responsibilities as set forth in this Article.


B. Membership.

1. The Board shall consist of three members. One member shall be appointed by the Governor of the State of Montana or, in lieu of such appointment, shall be the Governor. The salary and expenses of that member shall be paid by the State. One member shall be appointed by the Chairman of the Tribes, or in lieu of such appointment, shall be the Tribal Chairman. The salary and expenses of that member shall be paid by the Tribes. The third member shall be selected by agreement of the other two members. The salary and expenses of that member and all other expenses of the Board shall be shared equally by the State and the Tribes subject to the availability of funds. Each member duly appointed or selected shall hold office for a term of six years, and for so long thereafter until a successor shall be appointed or selected. The initial term of each member shall be staggered, with one member serving a six-year term, one a four-year term, and one a two-year term. The initial term of each member shall be chosen by lot, or by any other procedure and agreed upon in writing by the first three members of the Board. If the Governor or the Tribal Chairman serves on the Board, such person shall not serve on the Board beyond his or her term as Governor or Tribal Chairman.


2. Should the two appointed members fail to agree within sixty days of the effective date of this Compact or within thirty days after any vacancy occurs, on the selection of the third member, the following procedure shall be utilized:

(a) within five days each member shall nominate no more than five and no less than three persons to serve as a member of the Board;


(b) within fifteen days thereafter each member shall reject all but one of the persons nominated by the other member;


(c) the chief judge of the United States District Court for the District of Montana shall select the third member of the Board from the remaining two nominees. If the chief judge declines for any reason to select the third member, the chief justice of the Montana Supreme Court shall make the selection from the remaining two nominees.



3. Vacancies on the board shall be filled by appointment of a person to serve the unexpired term of the member whose seat has become vacant. If the member appointed by the Governor becomes unable or unwilling to serve on the Board, the Governor shall make the appointment within fifteen days. If the member appointed by the Tribal Chairman becomes unable or unwilling to serve, the Tribal Chairman shall make the appointment within fifteen days. If the third member of the Board becomes unable or unwilling to serve on the Board, the remaining members shall fill the vacancy under the procedure set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section.



C. Quorum and Vote Required. Two members of the Board shall constitute a quorum if reasonable notice has been provided in advance to the absent member. Meetings may be in person or, in appropriate circumstances, by telephone. All Board decisions shall be by a majority of the Board, shall be in writing and, together with any dissenting opinions, shall be delivered to all parties in the proceeding before the Board, and to both Parties to this Compact.


D. Jurisdiction of the Board. The Board shall have exclusive jurisdiction, only as provided in this Compact, to resolve any controversy over the use of ground water to which this Compact pertains, any controversy over the use of surface water within the Reservation or from any tributary of the Missouri River that flows through or adjacent to the Reservation, except the mainstem of the Milk River, and any controversy as to the meaning of this Compact between: (i) on the one hand, the Tribes or any person or persons claiming a right to use the Tribal Water Right;  and (ii) on the other hand, the State or any person or persons claiming a right to use water under the laws of the State.


E. Powers and Duties of the Board.

1. The Board shall have power to administer oaths to witnesses, to take evidence under oath, and to issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses or for the production of books, records, documents and other evidence. The courts of the Tribes and the State shall enforce any subpoena issued by the Board in the same manner as prescribed by the laws of the Tribes and the State for enforcing a subpoena issued in a civil action by courts of the Tribes and the State.


2. The Board shall hold hearings in proceedings before it and shall give advance notice to the Tribes, the State and all parties to any proceeding personally or by registered mail not less than five days before any hearing. Appearance at a hearing waives such notice. The Board may hear and determine the controversy upon the evidence produced notwithstanding the failure of a party duly notified to appear. The Tribes, the State and all parties to the proceeding are entitled to be heard, to present evidence material to the controversy, to cross-examine witnesses appearing at the hearing, and to be represented by counsel at their own expense.


3. The Board may enter an order after hearing granting any party to the dispute before it temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, or any other relief which the Board deems appropriate except money damages. The Board or any party to a proceeding before the Board may invoke the jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any temporary or preliminary injunction so issued by the Board by filing a petition for enforcement naming the enjoined person as respondent. Upon filing the petition, the court shall enter any order it deems appropriate for enforcement of the injunction ordered by the Board, including but not limited to injunctive relief on such terms as to bond or otherwise as it deems proper for the security of the rights of the enjoined party. The United States, the State, and the Tribes shall not be required to post any bond. The court may appoint a water commissioner or master to monitor compliance with such relief.


4. The Board shall adopt rules and regulations to govern its procedures and to carry out its responsibilities under this Compact. Such rules and regulations must be consistent with all provisions of this Compact. All records of the Board shall be open to public inspection except for privileged information.


5. The Board may employ or seek assistance of such clerical or other personnel and may establish such offices as it deems necessary for the performance of its functions according to this Compact. Pending the establishment of a principal office, the Board's office shall be located at Fort Peck Agency of the Bureau of Indian Affairs.


6. The annual budget of the Board shall be subject to approval of the Parties to this Compact and to the availability of funds appropriated by the Parties.



F. Review and Enforcement of Board Decisions.

1. Decisions by the Board shall be effective immediately, unless stayed for a period of time prescribed by the Board. On application of a party within a reasonable time, but in any event no more than ninety days after a decision is rendered, the Board may modify or correct any decision:

(a) where there was an evident material miscalculation of figures or an evident material mistake in the description of any person, thing or property referred to in the decision;


(b) where the decision is imperfect in a matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy;  or


(c) where the decision requires clarification.



2. Any party before the Board may, within ten days of any final decision, apply to the Board to modify or set aside any aspect of the decision. Notice of such application shall be served personally or by registered mail upon all parties to the proceeding. Any other party shall have ten days within which to respond to the application. The Board shall act on such application within ten days after a response is filed or, if no response is filed, within fifteen days after the application is filed. If the Board fails to act within the time limitations set forth in this paragraph, the application shall be deemed denied. The time for appeal provided in paragraph 3 of this section shall not begin to run until the application is determined as provided in this paragraph.


3. Any party before the Board may appeal any final decision by the Board to a court of competent jurisdiction within thirty days of such decision. The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board and served personally or by registered mail upon the Tribes, the State and all parties to the proceeding before the Board, and all such persons shall thereafter have the right to participate in the appeal.


4. In any appeal, the Board's decision shall be presumed to be valid, and may be vacated by the court only on one of the following grounds:

(a) the decision is not supported by substantial evidence;


(b) the decision was procured by corruption, fraud or undue means;


(c) there was evident partiality or corruption by the Board or by any member;


(d) the Board was guilty of misconduct in refusing to hear the dispute, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy, or any other clear misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been substantially prejudiced;


(e) the Board exceeded its authority under the terms of this Compact;  or


(f) the decision is contrary to law.



5. Unless an appeal is timely filed as provided in paragraph 3 of this section, any decision of the Board shall be confirmed or enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction on petition of the Board, the Tribes, the State or any party before the Board in the proceeding in which the decision was made.


6. A court of competent jurisdiction in which a timely appeal is filed pursuant to paragraph 3 of this section, or in which a petition to confirm or enforce is filed pursuant to paragraph 5 of this section, may order such temporary or permanent relief as it considers just and proper.


7. An appeal may be taken from any decision of the court in which a timely appeal is filed pursuant to paragraph 3 of this section, or in which a petition to confirm or enforce is filed pursuant to paragraph 5 of this section, in the manner and to the same extent as from orders or judgments of the court in a civil action.


8. In any appeal or petition to confirm or enforce the Board's decision, the Board shall file with the court the record of the proceedings before the Board.



G. Waiver of Immunity. The Tribes and the State hereby waive their respective immunities from suit, including any defense the State shall have under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, to permit the appeal or judicial enforcement of Board decisions as provided in this Compact, except that such waivers shall not extend to any action for money damages including costs and attorneys' fees as a result of such judicial action.

B. Incorporation into Decrees and Disposition of Federal Suits.

1. The Parties and the United States shall petition for incorporation of this Compact into the preliminary decrees and final decrees in any state water court proceedings to adjudicate any right to the use of water to which this Compact pertains, and this Compact may not be modified in any manner whatsoever without the consent of both Parties as provided in section A of this Article.

A. General Statement of the Tribal Water Right. The Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation have the right to divert annually from the Missouri River, certain of its tributaries, and ground water beneath the Reservation the lesser of (i) 1,050,472 acre-feet of water, or (ii) the quantity of water necessary to supply a consumptive use of 525,236 acre-feet per year for the uses and purposes set forth in this Compact with a priority date of May 1, 1888, provided that no more than 950,000 acre-feet of water, or the quantity of water necessary to supply a consumptive use of 475,000 acre-feet may be diverted annually from surface water sources. This right is held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Tribes and is further defined and limited as set forth in this Compact.


B. Persons Who May Use the Tribal Water Right. All uses of water authorized under any applicable law by the following persons shall be considered and calculated as uses of the Tribal Water Right:

1. the Tribes within or outside the Reservation;


2. all individual Indians using water within the Reservation including, but not limited to, Indians exercising uses established pursuant to state law prior to the effective date of this Compact;


3. all non-Indian successors-in-interest to any allottee actually using water within the Reservation by virtue of a water right arising under the laws of the United States, which water right was acquired directly or indirectly from an Indian predecessor-in-interest;


4. all other persons receiving water from the Fort Peck Irrigation Project including, but not limited to, persons exercising uses established pursuant to state law prior to the effective date of this Compact;


5. all other persons authorized to use water by the Tribes pursuant to this Compact, within or outside the Reservation;


6. the United States as trustee for the Tribes or any Indian including, but not limited to, persons exercising uses established pursuant to state law prior to the effective date of this Compact.



1. the Tribes within or outside the Reservation;


2. all individual Indians using water within the Reservation including, but not limited to, Indians exercising uses established pursuant to state law prior to the effective date of this Compact;


3. all non-Indian successors-in-interest to any allottee actually using water within the Reservation by virtue of a water right arising under the laws of the United States, which water right was acquired directly or indirectly from an Indian predecessor-in-interest;


4. all other persons receiving water from the Fort Peck Irrigation Project including, but not limited to, persons exercising uses established pursuant to state law prior to the effective date of this Compact;


5. all other persons authorized to use water by the Tribes pursuant to this Compact, within or outside the Reservation;


6. the United States as trustee for the Tribes or any Indian including, but not limited to, persons exercising uses established pursuant to state law prior to the effective date of this Compact.


C. Measure of Consumptive Use for Irrigation. Irrigation usage of the Tribal Water Right shall be conclusively deemed to cause a consumptive use of 1.8 acre-feet per acre per year for full service irrigation and 0.48 acre-feet per acre per year for partial service irrigation. Any loss of water due to evaporation from reservoirs constructed in the future for conservation (carry-over) storage rather than for regulatory storage by the United States for the benefit of the Tribes or any Indian, or constructed for such conservation storage by the Tribes or by any Indian, shall be counted as a consumptive use.


D. Purposes for Which the Tribal Water Right May be Used. Within the Reservation, use of water in the exercise of the Tribal Water Right for any purpose may be authorized by the Tribes without regard to whether such use is beneficial as defined by valid state law. No use of the Tribal Water Right may be wasteful or inconsistent with the terms of this Compact. Outside the Reservation, any use of water in the exercise of the Tribal Water Right shall be beneficial as defined by valid state law on the date the Tribes give notice to the State of a proposed use outside the Reservation.


E. Facilities Diverting or Using the Tribal Water Right Outside the Reservation. All persons diverting or using the Tribal Water Right outside the Reservation, including the Tribes as sovereign, shall apply for all permits, certificates, variances and other authorizations required by valid state laws regulating, conditioning or permitting the siting, construction, operation, alteration or use of any equipment, device, facility or associated facility proposed to use or transport water located outside the Reservation, and shall comply with all applicable provisions of this Compact. A diversion or use of water in the exercise of the Tribal Water Right may be made only after all permits, certificates, variances or other authorizations applied for pursuant to this paragraph have been obtained, and the diversion or use has not been found unlawful by a court of competent jurisdiction.

1. As an incident to and in the exercise of the Tribal Water Right, the Tribes may transfer within or outside the Reservation, as authorized by federal law and this Compact, the right to use water but may not permanently alienate such right or any part thereof. Any such transfer of water by the Tribes shall be subject to all provisions of this Compact.


2. Prior to making any transfer which authorizes use of water outside the Reservation to be diverted from the mainstem of the Missouri River, including Fort Peck Reservoir, the Tribes shall give not less than 180 days advance written notice to the State of the proposed terms and conditions of the transfer, and shall offer the State the opportunity to participate in the transfer as a substantially equal partner with the Tribes, assuming obligations and receiving benefits of the transfer under terms and conditions agreed to by the Parties. If the State does not accept the opportunity within the 180-day notice period, or if the State unreasonably delays the institution or completion of approval processes required by state law or unreasonably delays resolution of any litigation arising from its decision to accept the opportunity, the Tribes may proceed with the proposed transfer without State participation, provided that the proposed transfer shall be subject to all other provisions of this Compact. If the State does not accept the opportunity, or if State participation in the joint transfer is not approved, the State shall not later pursue the opportunity, except in accordance with all the terms of this Compact, including paragraph 3 of this section.


3. Prior to making any transfer allowing use or diversion of water from Fort Peck Reservoir or from the mainstem of the Missouri River below Fort Peck Dam, the State shall give not less than 180 days advance written notice to the Tribes of the proposed terms and conditions of the transfer and shall offer the Tribes the same opportunity to participate in the transfer as a substantially equal partner with the State, assuming obligations and receiving benefits of the transfer on terms and conditions agreed to by the Parties. If the Tribes do not accept the opportunity within the 180 day notice period, the State may proceed with the proposed transfer without the Tribes' participation, and the Tribes shall not later pursue the opportunity except in accordance with all the terms of this Compact, including paragraph 2 of this section.


4. If otherwise authorized by federal law, the Tribes may enter into an agreement with any person who is exercising or proposing to exercise a right under the laws of the State to use surface water outside the Reservation on any tributary of the Missouri River that flows through or adjacent to the Reservation, except the mainstem of the Milk River, which agreement allows such person's diversion and use and protects it from any other exercise of the Tribal Water Right provided, however, that:

(a) before use of such water, the person shall have complied with all applicable state laws concerning the acquisition of a water right;


(b) subsequent to acquisition of the state water right, regulation of its use shall be subject to state law;


(c) the amount of water subject to the agreement shall be considered a consumptive use of the Tribal Water Right;


(d) the agreement shall not permanently alienate the Tribal Water Right or any part thereof.

(c) plus 50 percent of any amount over 300,000 acre-feet authorized by state law to be transferred annually by the State from waters within the State.

Transfers of the Tribal Water Right shall not be considered as part of any amounts authorized by state law to be transferred annually by the State.


6. In no event shall the Tribes be authorized to transfer less than 50,000 acre-feet of water per year outside the Reservation. The limits established in paragraph 5 of this section shall apply so long as the State is authorized to transfer annually at least 50,000 acre-feet of water pursuant to state law. If statutory authorization for the State to transfer water is not enacted, is repealed, or is held invalid, or if the amount of water authorized by state law to be transferred by the State is less than 50,000 acre-feet per year, then for any period in which the authorization or the limitation is not in force the Tribes may transfer water in accordance with all terms and conditions of this Compact other than paragraph 5 of this section. However, such transfers will be subject to any volume limitations provided by federal law or, in the absence of any federal volume limitations, the Tribes may transfer water in accordance with all terms and conditions in this Compact other than paragraph 5 of this section and with any volume limitations imposed by state law which would apply to a holder of a right to the use of water established pursuant to state law. For the purposes of complying with volume limitations imposed by state law, the Tribal Water Right will be deemed to have the characteristics set forth in paragraph 4 of section J of this Article.


7. Unless authorized by federal law, the State shall not in any manner whatsoever tax any proceeds received by the Tribes as consideration for any transfer of the Tribal Water Right.



1. As an incident to and in the exercise of the Tribal Water Right, the Tribes may transfer within or outside the Reservation, as authorized by federal law and this Compact, the right to use water but may not permanently alienate such right or any part thereof. Any such transfer of water by the Tribes shall be subject to all provisions of this Compact.

If the State does not accept the opportunity within the 180-day notice period, or if the State unreasonably delays the institution or completion of approval processes required by state law or unreasonably delays resolution of any litigation arising from its decision to accept the opportunity, the Tribes may proceed with the proposed transfer without State participation, provided that the proposed transfer shall be subject to all other provisions of this Compact. If the State does not accept the opportunity, or if State participation in the joint transfer is not approved, the State shall not later pursue the opportunity, except in accordance with all the terms of this Compact, including paragraph 3 of this section.


3. Prior to making any transfer allowing use or diversion of water from Fort Peck Reservoir or from the mainstem of the Missouri River below Fort Peck Dam, the State shall give not less than 180 days advance written notice to the Tribes of the proposed terms and conditions of the transfer and shall offer the Tribes the same opportunity to participate in the transfer as a substantially equal partner with the State, assuming obligations and receiving benefits of the transfer on terms and conditions agreed to by the Parties. If the Tribes do not accept the opportunity within the 180 day notice period, the State may proceed with the proposed transfer without the Tribes' participation, and the Tribes shall not later pursue the opportunity except in accordance with all the terms of this Compact, including paragraph 2 of this section.


4. If otherwise authorized by federal law, the Tribes may enter into an agreement with any person who is exercising or proposing to exercise a right under the laws of the State to use surface water outside the Reservation on any tributary of the Missouri River that flows through or adjacent to the Reservation, except the mainstem of the Milk River, which agreement allows such person's diversion and use and protects it from any other exercise of the Tribal Water Right provided, however, that:

(a) before use of such water, the person shall have complied with all applicable state laws concerning the acquisition of a water right;


(b) subsequent to acquisition of the state water right, regulation of its use shall be subject to state law;


(c) the amount of water subject to the agreement shall be considered a consumptive use of the Tribal Water Right;


(d) the agreement shall not permanently alienate the Tribal Water Right or any part thereof.

The limits established in paragraph 5 of this section shall apply so long as the State is authorized to transfer annually at least 50,000 acre-feet of water pursuant to state law. If statutory authorization for the State to transfer water is not enacted, is repealed, or is held invalid, or if the amount of water authorized by state law to be transferred by the State is less than 50,000 acre-feet per year, then for any period in which the authorization or the limitation is not in force the Tribes may transfer water in accordance with all terms and conditions of this Compact other than paragraph 5 of this section. However, such transfers will be subject to any volume limitations provided by federal law or, in the absence of any federal volume limitations, the Tribes may transfer water in accordance with all terms and conditions in this Compact other than paragraph 5 of this section and with any volume limitations imposed by state law which would apply to a holder of a right to the use of water established pursuant to state law. For the purposes of complying with volume limitations imposed by state law, the Tribal Water Right will be deemed to have the characteristics set forth in paragraph 4 of section J of this Article.

These instream flows shall be a part of the Tribal Water Right with a priority date of May 1, 1888. Water remaining in a stream to maintain instream flows pursuant to such a schedule shall be counted by the Tribes as a consumptive use of surface water.


2. Instream flows may be established by the Tribes only in accordance with this section. The Tribes may change the use of water for maintenance of instream flows to another purpose only with the consent of the State.

ARTICLE IV--IMPLEMENTATION OF TRIBAL WATER RIGHT


A. General Provisions.

1. Trust Status of Tribal Water Right. The Tribal Water Right shall be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Tribe.


2. Tribal Water Right: Administration. Subject to the limitations imposed by this Compact and other federal law, the use of the Tribal Water Right shall be administered by the Tribe through the TWRD both on and off of the Reservation. Disputes, not within the jurisdiction of the Compact Board set forth in D.4. of Article IV, concerning off-Reservation use of the Tribal Water Right which raise issues concerning the application of state or federal law shall be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction. Those disputes concerning off-Reservation use of the Tribal Water Right which do not raise issues concerning the application of state or federal law will be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribe. Subject to the limitations imposed by this Compact, the Tribe shall have the final and exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes concerning the Tribal Water Right between users of the Tribal Water Right. The TWRD will, among other activities, develop policies and procedures for monitoring water use, diversions, and maintaining records of water use and development consistent with this Compact. The current and future water use and diversions will be identified by location and quantity. Final storage capacities will be based on project as-built plans, and will store no more than the water right set forth in Article III of this Compact. Administration and enforcement of the Tribal Water Right shall be pursuant to a Tribal water code, which shall be developed and adopted by the Tribe within two (2) years following the ratification date of this Compact pursuant to any requirements set forth in the Constitution of the Chippewa Cree Tribe. Pending the adoption of the Tribal water code, the administration and enforcement of the Tribal Water Right shall be by the Secretary of the Interior.


3. Use.

a. Persons Entitled to Use the Tribal Water Right.The Tribal Water Right may be used by the Tribe, or persons authorized by the Tribe.


b. Effect of Non-Use of Tribal Water Rights.Except as specifically provided herein, state law doctrines relating to the use of water rights, including but not limited to relinquishment, forfeiture or abandonment, do not apply to the Tribal Water Right. Thus, non-use of all or any of the Tribal Water Right described in Article III shall not constitute a relinquishment, forfeiture or abandonment of such rights.



4. Change in Use or Transfer.

a. On-Reservation Changes in Use or Transfer of the Tribal Water Right. Unless otherwise stated in this Compact, the Tribe may make a change in use or transfer of a water right set forth in Article III of this Compact on the Rocky Boy Reservation, including the use of water salvaged through the application of water-saving methods to expand irrigation, provided that:

(1) for each source quantified in Article III, any change in use or transfer shall not result in uses that exceed the water amount quantified for that source;


(2) any change in use or transfer shall not result in an increase in net depletion in the Beaver Creek drainage in excess of the amount specified for that source;


(3) any change in use or transfer shall not have an adverse effect on a water right recognized under state law with a priority date before the date of the change or transfer provided that for change in use or transfer of groundwater, the burden as to adverse effect shall be as set forth in Section A.6. of Article IV;  and


(4) any change in use or transfer shall not change the source of the water involved in any such changes.


(5) The Tribe may not make a change in use or transfer of any water rights set forth in Article III for the purposes of stockwatering or fish and wildlife enhancement;  provided that, the Tribe may repair or relocate an impoundment for stockwatering or fish and wildlife enhancement within the drainage of origin;  and provided further that, the new point of diversion or place of use does not change to a place from upstream of to downstream of, or from downstream of to upstream of the location of the point of diversion of a water right recognized under state law with a priority date before the date the Compact is ratified by the State and the Tribe, whichever date is later.


(6) The Tribe may not make a change in use or transfer any of the water rights set forth in Article III with a source on the drainages of Upper Big Sandy Creek, Camp Creek, Duck Creek and Gorman Creek that results in a change in the place of use, point of diversion or place or means of storage of the water outside the drainage of origin or to a place from upstream of to downstream of, or from downstream of to upstream of the location of the point of diversion of a water right recognized under state law with a priority date before the date the Compact is ratified by the State and the Tribe, whichever date is later.


(7) The Tribe may make a change in use or transfer of the irrigation water right with a source in Upper Big Sandy Creek drainage as set forth in Section A.5.e. of Article III so long as it does so within the diversionary limits set forth in Section A.5.d. of Article III;  provided that, the net depletion shall not exceed 30 AFY.



b. Off-Reservation Changes in Use or Transfer of the Tribal Water Right. Except as may be otherwise provided in this Compact, the Tribe, pursuant to federal law, may make or permit a change in use or a transfer of the Tribal Water Right for use off the Reservation;  provided that, any transfer shall be for a term of not to exceed 100 years, and may include provisions authorizing renewal for an additional term of not to exceed 100 years;  and provided further that, no such transfer shall be a permanent alienation of the water transferred;  and provided further that, no transfer or change in place of use shall be made to a location outside the watershed that forms the Missouri River drainage;  and provided further that, if the Tribe receives a good faith offer from a third person from outside the Milk River drainage to acquire use of specified Tribal water rights and the Tribe is willing to accept the terms of the offer, the Tribe, before accepting the offer, shall allow water users in the Milk River drainage the opportunity to acquire use of such rights at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those contained in the offer. Any change in use or transfer of any such water right involving a point of diversion or place of use located off the Reservation shall be considered an off-Reservation use;  provided that, any off-Reservation use of Tribal water rights described in this Compact shall not be deemed to convert such rights to rights arising under state law, and nonuse of such rights off the Reservation shall not constitute a relinquishment, forfeiture, or abandonment of the rights;  and provided further that, releases or diversions from Lake Elwell for use on the Reservation shall not be considered off-Reservation uses. The Tribe may change the point of diversion or purpose or place of use of the Tribal Water Right back to the Reservation without reduction in the amount of water provided in the Compact.

(b) The TWRD shall review the application and make a determination of whether the new use will have an adverse effect on existing water rights recognized under state law with a priority date before the application date. Upon request by the TWRD, the DNRC shall provide information on existing state water rights as recorded in the DNRC database to the TWRD.


(c) If the TWRD determines that the new development will have an adverse effect on a water right recognized under state law with a priority date before the application date, the TWRD shall deny the application. If the TWRD determines that the new development will not have an adverse effect on a water right recognized under state law with a priority date before the application date, the TWRD shall forward the application with its determination to the DNRC.


(d) If, based upon the evidence, DNRC agrees with the TWRD's determination, the application will be approved. If, however, based upon the evidence, the DNRC cannot agree with the determination of the TWRD, DNRC shall publish notice, of the application once in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the source and shall serve notice by first-class mail on any appropriator of water or holder of a permit who, according to the records of the department, has a water right with a priority date before the application date, and may be affected by the proposed development.


(e) DNRC and the TWRD shall attempt to resolve any disagreement on the determination of no adverse effect by the TWRD on a cooperative basis. If the DNRC or a holder of a water right recognized under state law with a priority date before the application date disagree with the determination of no adverse effect, DNRC or the water users may seek relief from the Compact Board.


(f) In any proceeding concerning the effect of new groundwater development on the Reservation either before the TWRD, the DNRC, or before the Compact Board, the following shall apply:

(i) 1--150 Feet Wells: For new Tribal groundwater wells completed at a depth beneath the surface of 1 to 150 feet, the Tribe shall bear the burden of showing no adverse effect to groundwater uses recognized under state law with a priority date before the application date.


(ii) 150 Feet or Deeper Wells: For Tribal groundwater wells completed at a depth beneath the surface of 150 feet or deeper, the owner of a water right recognized under state law with a priority date before the application date shall bear the burden of showing any adverse effect to the water right.





b. Groundwater Development Exempt From The Showing Of No Adverse Effect. The following wells are exempt from the requirement of showing no adverse effect:

(1) Existing Tribal wells are exempt from the burden to show no adverse effect. The Tribe may develop existing wells, or replacements therefor, to their full capacity. The primary municipal and domestic wells are listed in Appendix 8. A comprehensive list of existing wells will be kept on file in TWRD offices as per the requirement to list existing uses in Section A.5. of Article IV.


(2) New Tribal groundwater wells producing from the Volcanic Bedrock Aquifer may be developed without a showing of no adverse effect.



c. Ancestral Missouri River Channel Aquifer. Groundwater from the Ancestral Missouri River Channel Aquifer shall be a primary source for non-irrigation uses;  provided that, the non-irrigation uses do not result in discharge of untreated water to land or surface water. Groundwater from the Ancestral Missouri River Channel Aquifer is a supplemental source for irrigation uses.



7. Moratorium.

a. New State Permits. With the exceptions listed in subsection (1) of this section, the DNRC shall not process or grant an application for a permit to appropriate water from a source in the Big Sandy Creek Basin (excluding Sage Creek and Lonesome Lake Coulee), and in the Beaver Creek drainage after the date this Compact is ratified by the Montana Legislature and by the Chippewa Cree Business Committee, whichever date is later. This moratorium shall remain in effect for a minimum of 10 years and shall only be lifted pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section A.7.b of Article IV. This moratorium is not intended to apply to applications for change in appropriation under state law.

(1) The moratorium shall not apply to the following appropriations:

(a) an appropriation of groundwater by means of a well or developed spring with a maximum appropriation of 35 gallons per minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet per year unless the appropriation is a combined appropriation from the same source from two or more wells or developed springs exceeding the limitation;


(b) an appropriation of water for use by livestock if the maximum capacity of the impoundment or pit is less than 15 acre-feet and the appropriation is less than 30 acre-feet per year and is from a source other than a perennial flowing stream;


(c) an appropriation of groundwater from any deep aquifer not hydrologically connected to surface water.



(2) Within 120 days following the date the moratorium takes effect, the DNRC shall publish notice of the moratorium once in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the source and shall serve notice by first-class mail on all appropriators of water or holders of permits who, according to the records of the department, have a water right with a source in the affected drainages.


(3) The moratorium applies only to new permits issued under state law and is not a limit on new development of the Tribal Water Right as set forth in this Compact.



b. Lifting of Moratorium. After 10 years, the Tribe or an individual seeking to appropriate water in the affected drainages may petition the DNRC for removal of the moratorium, or the DNRC may initiate proceedings to lift a moratorium on its own initiative. The DNRC shall comply with the following procedure in making a determination as to whether water is available in excess of the Tribal Water Right and rights recognized under state law. The DNRC and TWRD may agree to modify procedures or provide additional procedures. Such modification is pursuant to and shall not be deemed to be a modification of the Compact.

(1) Proceedings initiated by TWRD.

(a) The TWRD shall have sixty (60) days following the filing of the petition requesting that the moratorium be lifted to provide the DNRC with data supporting its petition to lift the moratorium.


(b) Within sixty (60) days following the receipt of the data supporting TWRD's petition, the DNRC shall determine whether to lift the moratorium, and shall notify the TWRD of its determination and the grounds therefor. The TWRD shall be allowed reasonable access to any data relied upon by the DNRC for its determination.


(c) Within thirty (30) days following a determination by the DNRC not to lift the moratorium, the TWRD may challenge the DNRC's determination in a de novo proceeding before the Compact Board. The moratorium shall continue pending Compact Board proceedings and any appeal



(2) Proceedings initiated by DNRC.

(a) The DNRC may, on request by a water user or on its own initiative, commence proceedings to determine whether to lift a moratorium.


(b) The DNRC shall notify the TWRD of the commencement of proceedings to determine whether to lift the moratorium and shall submit to the TWRD all data in support of the proceedings at the same time or as soon after such data becomes available as practical or shall give the TWRD reasonable access to such data within the same time frame.


(c) The TWRD shall be given sixty (60) days following receipt of the data in support of the proceedings to submit to the DNRC a statement of the Tribe's position concerning the issue along with any supporting data and argument.


(d) The DNRC shall notify the TWRD of its determination and the grounds therefor within sixty (60) days of receipt of the Tribe's statement.


(e) Within thirty (30) days following a determination by the DNRC not to lift the moratorium, the TWRD may challenge the DNRC's determination in a de novo proceeding before the Compact Board. The moratorium shall continue pending Compact Board proceedings and any appeal.




c. Excess Water. If the moratorium is lifted pursuant to the procedure described in A.7.b. of Article IV, the Tribe shall have the first right to use the excess water for the purpose of fulfilling new reserved water rights, if any, on land acquired after the ratification date of this Compact, but before the date the moratorium is lifted. The excess water used by the Tribe shall become part of the Tribal Water Right and the tribe may make a change in use of, or transfer, including storage, of such water pursuant to Section A.4.a. of Article IV.


d. Limit on New Tribal Groundwater Development. In any drainage with a moratorium, new Tribal groundwater development pursuant to Section C.1. of Article III, by a well or developed spring from an aquifer that is hydrologically connected to surface water shall be limited to a maximum appropriation or combined appropriation from two or more wells or developed springs in a single drainage defined by this Compact to 35 gallons per minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet per year.



8. Mutual Subordination.To reduce the need for daily administration of water use on and off the Reservation, water rights shall not be administered in priority, but shall be satisfied according to the following agreements.

a. Subordination to Non-Tribal Water Rights Upstream of the Reservation.The Tribal Water Right shall be subordinate to water rights recognized under state law upstream from any point on the Reservation with a priority date before the ratification date of this Compact. It is the intent of the parties that this subordination extends only to valid water rights, and not to statements of claim filed pursuant to 
85-2-221, MCA
. With the exception of rights exempt from filing in the state adjudication pursuant to 
85-2-222, MCA
, and rights exempt from the permit process pursuant to 
85-2-306, MCA
, a list of rights as currently claimed is attached as Appendix 3. Appendix 3 will be modified by any final decree resolving claims on the affected drainages. Appendix 3 may be modified due to clerical error or omission.


b. Effect of Mitigation. Because the impact of development of the Tribal Water Right on downstream water rights recognized under State law has been mitigated by provisions of the Compact and by special measures set forth in drainage stipulations, any person claiming or holding a water right recognized under State law, or an interest in such water right, may not assert priority over, or make a call for, or claim any of the water rights of the Tribe set forth in this Compact, in any court, tribunal, or other forum.



9. Stockwatering Impoundments Limited by Surface Area. Except for new stock ponds developed under Section C.2. of Article III, the surface acreage limitations on stockwatering impoundments set forth in Article III shall be the measure of compliance with the quantification of water rights for the purpose of stockwatering.


10. Impoundments for the Purpose of Enhancing Fish and Wildlife Habitat.

a. Fish and Wildlife Enhancement Impoundments Limited by Surface Area. The surface acreage limitations on impoundments for the purpose of fish and wildlife enhancement set forth in Article III shall be the measure of compliance with the quantification of water rights for the purpose of fish and wildlife enhancement.


b. Limits on Structures. No structure for the purpose of fish and wildlife enhancement may create a potential high water line beyond the existing wet riparian habitat delineated as fish and wildlife enhancement zones on the map attached as Appendix 4.



11. Structures Mimic Natural Processes. No structure for the purpose of fish and wildlife enhancement, or new stockwatering impoundments on a perennial stream built after the ratification date of the Compact, excluding repair or replacement of existing structures, may stop the entire flow of surface water during filling of the impoundment. To accomplish this the Tribe shall build any structure to mimic natural processes by allowing water to flow through the structure, or bypass the structure during filling.



B. Big Sandy Creek Basin.

1. Operation of Bonneau Reservoir.

a. Minimum Pool/240 AFY Stored for Satisfaction of Release. The minimum pool at Bonneau Reservoir shall be established by the Tribe. The Tribe shall store annually the minimum pool plus 240 acre-feet, if water is available. The 240 acre-feet above the minimum pool shall be stored to satisfy the release set forth in this Article and shall not be available to satisfy the Tribal Water Right. Evaporative loss shall be accounted for in setting the minimum pool and shall not be subtracted from the 240 acre-foot pool stored for downstream water users. Any change in use of the water stored in Bonneau Reservoir from irrigation to other purposes shall be without adverse effect on downstream water uses recognized under state law with a priority date before the date of change, and measures to prevent adverse effect may include release of additional water from Bonneau Reservoir.


b. Release for Off-Reservation Irrigation Use. The Tribe shall release no more than 104 AFY from Bonneau Reservoir or from direct flow of Box Elder Creek to satisfy the claims for irrigation water rights currently held by Bert Corcoran, and the Tribe shall deliver this water to a point of diversion specified in the drainage stipulation between the Tribe and Mr. Corcoran attached as part of Appendix 2;  provided that, the Tribe shall have no responsibility to upgrade or to increase the capacity of the existing delivery system;  and further provided that, the Tribe shall not be required to release water from Bonneau Reservoir below the minimum pool established by the Tribe plus 240 acre-feet prior to satisfaction of the 240 acre-feet per year release set forth in Section B.1.c. of Article IV, and the minimum pool at all other times. The 104 AFY release shall be in accordance with a delivery schedule agreed to by Mr. Corcoran, or his successors in interest, and the TWRD. Mr. Corcoran's claims for irrigation water rights shall be specified in the drainage stipulation between the Tribe and Mr. Corcoran attached as part of Appendix 2. Nothing in the drainage stipulation or in this Compact shall affect any existing right that Mr. Corcoran may have to the use of on-Reservation conveyance and distribution systems to deliver this water.


c. 240 AFY Release. The Tribe shall annually release the first 240 acre-feet of water, as measured near the confluence of Box Elder Creek and Lower Big Sandy Creek, stored in Bonneau Reservoir above the minimum pool, at the request of the downstream irrigation water users as set forth below, for maintenance of instream flow and for domestic and stock purposes on Lower Big Sandy Creek. The 240 AF of water, once released, shall be designated as an instream flow and shall be senior to all Tribal diversions and all non-domestic and non-stockwater rights recognized under state law from the point of release to the confluence with the Milk River. The Tribe shall not divert from direct flow on Lower Big Sandy Creek between its confluence with Box Elder Creek and the Reservation boundary at Stoneman Farms, as that boundary exists on the effective date of this Compact, during release of the 240 AF of water to downstream water users in the months of July and August. A structure that will bypass the peak scheduled release will be constructed for any diversion of the Tribal Water Right upstream of the confluence of Big Sandy Creek with Gravel Coulee. Under no circumstances shall the Tribe be required to release more than 240 AFY of water to maintain instream flow and for domestic and stock purposes.


d. Schedule for 240 AFY. The method for determining the schedule of releases is as follows: Water users on Lower Big Sandy Creek with drainage stipulations listed in Appendix 2 shall elect a three member Bonneau Release Committee to determine the schedule of release for the 240 AFY. The Committee shall notify the DNRC which shall notify the TWRD by May 1st of each year of the requested schedule. The schedule shall not exceed the operating standards of Bonneau Reservoir or result in unreasonable interference of the Tribe's use of water stored in the Reservoir. If the TWRD does not receive notice by May 1 of any year, the TWRD shall release 2 cfs continuously for July and August in accordance with Section B.1.c. of Article IV. DNRC shall notify water users which, according to the records of the Department, have a water right recognized under state law with a source on Box Elder Creek, or on Big Sandy Creek between the confluence with Box Elder Creek and the confluence with the Milk River, that the release may not be diverted. After May 1, at the request of the Bonneau Release Committee, the DNRC shall request the Tribe to alter the rate of release and the Tribe may agree to comply. At the request of the Tribe, the DNRC shall request the Bonneau Release Committee to agree to forego the release, and if the Committee believes the purposes for the release as set forth in Section B.1.c. of Article IV are being satisfied without the release, the Committee may, in any year, agree to forego the release. When streamflow in lower Big Sandy Creek at the bypass structure referred to in Section B.1.c. of Article IV, exceeds the peak flow specified in the designated release schedule, such excess flow can be diverted by the Tribe, subject to the diversion limits designated in Article III.


e. Effective Date for Bonneau Reservoir Operational Plan.Notwithstanding ratification of this Compact by the parties, the operational plan for Bonneau Reservoir set forth in Sections B.1.a. through c. of Article IV, shall not become effective until completion of the enlargement of Bonneau Dam.



2. Water Use on Lower Big Sandy Creek Drainage.

a. 2 cfs Bypass at Stoneman Farms. Structures will be constructed at each point of diversion on Lower Big Sandy Creek which allow a minimum of 2 cfs of water flow from direct and return flow, if available, to pass year around from the most downstream diversion on the Reservation on Lower Big Sandy Creek. The 2 cfs shall be designated as an instream flow and shall be senior in priority to Tribal diversions and all non-domestic and non-stockwatering water rights recognized under state law with a point of diversion between the bypass and the confluence with the Milk River. When streamflow in Lower Big Sandy Creek exceeds 2 cfs outside the scheduled 240 AF release period, such excess flow can be diverted by the Tribe subject to diversion limits designated in Article III.


b. Water Quality Issues.

(1) Monitoring Wells.Within one year following the effective date of this Compact, a monitoring well network adequate to detect saline seep shall be installed to depths no greater than 30 feet near the proposed Enlarged Stoneman Reservoir site shown in Appendix 6. The location of the wells will be established by TWRD and DNRC (or its representative) and groundwater level and quality shall be measured on a quarterly basis to establish baseline conditions.


(2) Water Quality Monitoring Before Construction. Within one year following the effective date of this Compact, a surface water quality network will be established by TWRD and DNRC and quarterly sampling continued for a sufficient period of time to establish the water quality baseline conditions referred to above, adjacent to and below the Stoneman Farms project. The results of the baseline analysis will be used to establish a threshold value for water quality degradation associated with salinity which will trigger the requirement for more extensive study.


(3) Water Quality Monitoring After Construction.After construction of the Stoneman Reservoir enlargement, monitoring of the wells and surface water quality will be resumed to evaluate changes in water quality. If salinity measurements result in a trend of increasing salinity on a sustained basis over a reasonable period of time, the TWRD or DNRC may petition the Compact Board to appoint a technical expert to conduct an analysis to identify the causes of the increasing salinity and recommend appropriate remedies. The analysis and recommendations may include sources of salinity off the Reservation.


(4) Remedies.The results of the analysis shall be submitted to the DNRC and to the TWRD which shall make a joint effort to resolve the degradation issue based on the analyses. If the analysis includes sources of salinity off the Reservation, the DNRC shall assist the TWRD in obtaining reasonable access onto the land off the Reservation for the purpose of observation. If the DNRC and the TWRD, are unable to resolve the issue within 30 days through joint effort, the DNRC, the TWRD, or any affected water user, may petition the Compact Board for relief. The Compact Board shall have jurisdiction over any contributor to the salinity problem and shall fashion its remedy in a manner proportionate to the causes contributing to the problem. The remedy fashioned by the Compact Board for salinity problems shall be limited to issuance of an order to cease and desist the practice or practices leading to the salinity problems. The remedies set forth in this section shall be in addition to any remedies or water quality standards provided for under other applicable law.





C. Beaver Creek Drainage.

1. Moratorium on Tribal Consumptive Uses.For a period of five years following the ratification date of the Compact, there shall be a moratorium on the development of Tribal consumptive uses from surface water in the Beaver Creek drainage. During this moratorium, a monitoring network consisting of three continuous recording stations will be installed and the resulting data analyzed to determine if Beaver Creek gains or loses flow between the confluence of East and West Fork and the Reservation boundary. Location of the three gages shall be:

(1) the West Fork of Beaver Creek at the location the Tribe intends to divert water to the East Fork;


(2) the confluence of the East and West Forks of Beaver Creek;  and


(3) the Reservation boundary at the most downstream point on Beaver Creek. A staff gage shall also be installed in East Fork Reservoir following enlargement of the Reservoir.



2. Development of Management Plan.Based on the results of the five years of gage data on Beaver Creek, the Tribe and the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks shall work cooperatively to develop a fishery and recreational management plan. The plan may include modifications in minimum instream flows set forth in Section C.3. of Article IV. Such modification is pursuant to, and will not be deemed a modification of, this Compact. The management plan is not binding on any party and shall not be used to modify minimum instream flows until it is approved by the Tribe and the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.


3. Operation of East Fork Reservoir Following Enlargement and Pending Adoption of a Management Plan.During the moratorium imposed by Section C.1. of Article IV, or pending adoption of the management plan authorized by Section C.2. of Article IV, East Fork Reservoir may be enlarged;  provided that,

a. The enlarged Reservoir shall be used only for recreational purposes during the five year moratorium. However, after the five year moratorium period and pending adoption of the management plan, the enlarged Reservoir may be utilized for multiple purposes, but remains subject to the limitations set forth under Sections C.3.b., c., and d. of Article IV.


b. Any surface water diversion from the West Fork of Beaver Creek and its tributaries on the Reservation to the East Fork of Beaver Creek shall include a structure which allows a minimum of 1 cfs of water flow from direct and return flow, if available, to pass year around;  provided that, the storing of water in East Fork Reservoir from the East Fork of Beaver Creek shall not be considered a diversion for the purposes of this provision.


c. For the drainage area below the confluence of the East and West Forks of Beaver Creek to the northern Reservation boundary, any surface water diversion from Beaver Creek and its tributaries on the Reservation shall include a structure which allows a minimum of 1 cfs of water flow from direct and return flow, if available, to pass year around;  provided that, the storing of water in East Fork Reservoir from the East Fork of Beaver Creek shall not be considered a diversion for the purposes of this provision.


d. The Tribe shall release water from East Fork Reservoir to augment streamflow on Beaver Creek if the flow at the confluence of East and West Fork or below the most downstream diversion on the Reservation, whichever is the most downstream, falls below 1 cfs;  provided that, the Tribe shall not be required to release water if the level of the enlarged Reservoir reaches or falls below the minimum pool;  and provided further that, the Tribe shall not be required to release water if the flow at the Reservation boundary at the most downstream point on Beaver Creek exceeds 2 cfs.



4. Operation of East Fork Reservoir Prior to Enlargement.Prior to enlargement of East Fork Reservoir and pending adoption of the management plan authorized by Section C.2. of Article IV, the following diversionary constraints are in effect.

a. Any surface water diversion from the West and East Forks of Beaver Creek and its tributaries on the Reservation shall include a structure which allows a minimum of 1 cfs of water flow from direct and return flow, if available, to pass the structure year around.


b. For the drainage area below the confluence of the East and West Forks of Beaver Creek to the northern Reservation boundary, any surface water diversion from Beaver Creek and its tributaries on the Reservation shall include a structure which allows a minimum of 1 cfs of water flow from direct and return flow, if available, to pass year round.




D. Enforcement--Chippewa Cree-Montana Compact Board.

1. Establishment of Board. There is hereby established the Chippewa Cree-Montana Compact Board. The Board shall consist of three members: one member selected by the Governor of the State of Montana from up to six nominees, up to three nominated by the Commissioners of Chouteau County and up to three nominated by the Commissioners of Hill County;  one member appointed by the Chippewa Cree Business Committee;  and one member selected by the other two members. If the Governor fails to select a board member from the list of nominees, the Commissioners of Chouteau and Hill Counties may select the member. All members shall be appointed within six months of the ratification date of this Compact and within thirty days of the date any vacancy occurs. If an appointment is not timely made by the Governor or County Commissioners, the Director of DNRC or his/her designee shall fill the State's position. If an appointment is not timely made by the Chippewa Cree Business Committee, the Director of the TWRD or his/her designee shall fill the Tribe's position. Each member shall serve a five-year term and shall be eligible for reappointment. The initial term of each member shall be staggered with one member serving a five-year term, one a four-year term, and one a three-year term. The initial term of each member shall be chosen by lot. Expenses of the members appointed by the State and the Tribe shall be borne by the entity appointing the member. The expenses of the third member and all other expenses shall be borne equally by the Tribe and the State, subject to the availability of funds.


2. Membership. Should the two appointed members fail to agree on the selection of a third member within sixty days of the date of appointment of the second member, or within thirty days after any vacancy occurs, the following procedure shall be utilized:

a. Within five days thereafter each member shall nominate three persons to serve as a member of the Board;


b. Within fifteen days thereafter each member shall reject two of the persons nominated by the other member;


c. Within five days thereafter, the remaining two nominees shall be submitted to the Dean of the University of Montana School of Law who shall select the third member from the two nominees.



3. Quorum and Vote Required. Two members of the Board shall constitute a quorum if reasonable notice of the time, place, and purpose of the meeting, hearing, or other proceeding has been provided in advance to the absent member. All Board decisions shall be by a majority of the Board, shall be in writing and, together with any dissenting opinions, shall be served on all parties in the proceeding before the Board, and on the parties to this Compact.


4. Jurisdiction of the Board. The Chippewa Cree-Montana Compact Board shall have jurisdiction to resolve controversies over the right to the use of water as between users of the Tribal Water Right and users of water rights recognized under state law including any contributor to a salinity problem. Such controversies shall include, but shall not be limited to, disputes as to the meaning of this Compact.


5. Pre-requisite Administrative Remedy.

a. Any non-tribal water user concerned that a new development or change in use of water by the Tribe is inconsistent with the Compact shall first contact the Havre Regional Office of the DNRC. If the DNRC and the TWRD are unable to resolve the issue in a reasonable time through discussion, DNRC, the water user, or the Tribe may seek relief through the Compact Board. The Tribe agrees to allow DNRC reasonable access onto Tribal land to observe the challenged development or change in use.


b. The Tribe or any tribal water user concerned that a new development or change in use or transfer of water by non-tribal water users is inconsistent with the Compact shall first contact the TWRD. If the TWRD and the DNRC are unable to resolve the issue in a reasonable time through discussion, the TWRD or the Tribal water user may seek relief through the Compact Board. The DNRC agrees to assist the TWRD in obtaining reasonable access onto the non-tribal water user's land to observe the challenged development or change in use or transfer.


c. The TWRD and the DNRC may jointly develop supplemental procedures as necessary or appropriate. Such supplemental procedures are pursuant to, and will not be deemed a modification of, this Compact.



6. Powers and Duties. The Board shall hold hearings upon notice in proceedings before it and shall have the power to administer oaths, take evidence and issue subpoenas to compel attendance of witnesses or production of documents or other evidence, and to appoint a technical expert for the purposes of Section B.2.b. of Article IV. The Tribe and the State shall enforce the Board's subpoenas in the same manner as prescribed by the laws of the Tribe and the State for enforcing a subpoena issued by the courts of each respective sovereign in a civil action. The parties to the controversy may present evidence and cross examine any witnesses. The Board shall determine the controversy and grant any appropriate relief, including a temporary order;  provided that, the Board shall have no power to award money damages, costs, or attorneys fees. All decisions of the Board shall be by majority vote and in writing. The Board shall adopt necessary rules and regulations to carry out its responsibilities within six months after its first meeting. All records of the Board shall be open to public inspection, except as otherwise ordered by the Board.


7. Review and Enforcement of Board Decisions.

a. Decisions by the Board shall be effective immediately, unless stayed by the Board. Unless otherwise provided by Congress, only the United States and parties to the proceedings before the Board may appeal any final decision by the Board to a court of competent jurisdiction within thirty (30) days of such decision. The hearing on appeal shall be a trial de novo. The notice of appeal shall be filed with the Board and served personally or by registered mail upon all parties to the proceeding before the Board.


b. Unless an appeal is filed within thirty (30) days of a final decision of the Board, as provided in Section D.7.a. of Article IV, any decision of the Board shall be recognized and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction on petition of the Board, or any party before the Board in the proceeding in which the decision was made.


c. A court of competent jurisdiction in which a timely appeal is filed pursuant to Section D.7.a. of Article IV, or in which a petition to confirm or enforce is filed pursuant to Section D.7.b. of Article IV, may order such temporary or permanent relief as it considers just and proper.


d. Any appeal may be taken from any decision of the court in which a timely appeal is filed pursuant to Section D.7.a. of Article IV, or in which a petition to confirm or enforce is filed pursuant to Section D.7.b. of Article IV, in the manner and to the same extent as from orders or judgments of the court in a civil action.


e. In any appeal or petition to confirm or enforce the Board's decision, the Board shall file with the court the record of the proceedings before the Board within sixty (60) days of filing of a notice of appeal.



8. Waiver of Immunity. The Tribe and the State hereby waive their respective immunities from suit, including any defense the State shall have under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in order to permit the resolution of disputes under this Compact by the Chippewa Cree-Montana Compact Board, and the appeal or judicial enforcement of Board decisions as provided herein, except that such waivers of sovereign immunity by the Tribe or the State shall not extend to any action for money damages, costs, or attorneys' fees. The parties agree that only Congress can waive the immunity of the United States. The participation of the United States in the proceedings of the Compact Board shall be as provided by Congress.

ARTICLE VI--CONTRIBUTIONS TO SETTLEMENT

The Tribe and the State of Montana agree to support federal legislation ratifying this Compact that will accomplish the following:

A. Off-Reservation Water Sources.

1. Lake Elwell Water Supply.The State and the Tribe agree to support federal legislation that will provide an allocation of 10,000 acre-feet per year from storage water in Lake Elwell, as described in Section C.6. of Article III. The priority date of this water right shall be that established for the source of supply. This water right will be held in trust and will be part of the Tribal Water Right.


2. Right to Participate in Future Projects to Import Water to the Milk River.The Tribe shall have the right to participate in any project to augment the water supply in the Milk River system by transferring water from another drainage, and to have any such augmentation project deliver any entitlement of the Tribe to water to a point on the Reservation designated by the Tribe.



B. Provision Of A Municipal, Rural, And Industrial Water Supply System, And A Tribal Economic Development Fund.

The State and Tribe agree to support federal legislation that will authorize and fund a municipal, rural and industrial water system adequate to meet the future MR & I water needs of the Tribe, according to the needs and population projections as set forth in the Municipal, Rural and Industrial (MR & I) Water Supply System Needs Assessment prepared for the Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Department of the Interior (January, 1996), through either a regional system or a system serving the Reservation only. The State and Tribe further agree to support federal legislation that will establish an economic development fund as agreed to by the Tribe and the Department of the Interior, or by the Tribe and the Montana Congressional Delegation. Support by the Department of Interior for the proposed MR & I system will depend on a demonstration of feasibility and appropriate allocation of costs.

C. Implementation Contingencies and Cost Share of Administration and Mitigation.

Implementation of this Compact shall be contingent upon the appropriation of necessary funds by the Congress and by the Montana Legislature. The performance of any obligation by any party under this Compact shall be contingent upon appropriation of funds therefor. No liability shall accrue to any party in case necessary funds are not appropriated. The State and the Tribe agree to recommend the following cost share for administration and mitigation necessary to implement the Compact to the Montana State Legislature and the Congress for appropriation on a schedule consistent with implementation as contemplated in this Compact.

1. The State and the Tribe agree to support federal legislation to appropriate $3,070,000 for the administration of the Tribal Water Right by the Tribal Water Resources Department as set forth in Articles III and IV of the Compact, including but not limited to: stream flow gages;  diversion/bypass structures on Big Sandy Creek;  aerial survey of impoundments on the Reservation;  and development of a Tribal Water Code.

ARTICLE VIII--LEGISLATION

The State and Tribe agree to seek enactment of any legislation necessary to effectuate the provisions and purposes of this Compact, and to defend the provisions and purposes of this Compact from all challenges and attacks;  provided that, no provision of the Compact shall be modified as to substance except as may be provided herein.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the representatives of the State of Montana, the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation, and the United States have signed this Compact on the 28th day of February, 2000.





A. General Provisions.

1. Trust Status of Tribal Water Right. The Tribal Water Right shall be held in trust by the United States for the benefit of the Tribe.


2. Tribal Water Right: Administration. Subject to the limitations imposed by this Compact and other federal law, the use of the Tribal Water Right shall be administered by the Tribe through the TWRD both on and off of the Reservation. Disputes, not within the jurisdiction of the Compact Board set forth in D.4. of Article IV, concerning off-Reservation use of the Tribal Water Right which raise issues concerning the application of state or federal law shall be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction. Those disputes concerning off-Reservation use of the Tribal Water Right which do not raise issues concerning the application of state or federal law will be within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribe. Subject to the limitations imposed by this Compact, the Tribe shall have the final and exclusive jurisdiction to resolve all disputes concerning the Tribal Water Right between users of the Tribal Water Right. The TWRD will, among other activities, develop policies and procedures for monitoring water use, diversions, and maintaining records of water use and development consistent with this Compact. The current and future water use and diversions will be identified by location and quantity. Final storage capacities will be based on project as-built plans, and will store no more than the water right set forth in Article III of this Compact. Administration and enforcement of the Tribal Water Right shall be pursuant to a Tribal water code, which shall be developed and adopted by the Tribe within two (2) years following the ratification date of this Compact pursuant to any requirements set forth in the Constitution of the Chippewa Cree Tribe. Pending the adoption of the Tribal water code, the administration and enforcement of the Tribal Water Right shall be by the Secretary of the Interior.


3. Use.

a. Persons Entitled to Use the Tribal Water Right.The Tribal Water Right may be used by the Tribe, or persons authorized by the Tribe.


b. Effect of Non-Use of Tribal Water Rights.Except as specifically provided herein, state law doctrines relating to the use of water rights, including but not limited to relinquishment, forfeiture or abandonment, do not apply to the Tribal Water Right. Thus, non-use of all or any of the Tribal Water Right described in Article III shall not constitute a relinquishment, forfeiture or abandonment of such rights.



4. Change in Use or Transfer.

a. On-Reservation Changes in Use or Transfer of the Tribal Water Right. Unless otherwise stated in this Compact, the Tribe may make a change in use or transfer of a water right set forth in Article III of this Compact on the Rocky Boy Reservation, including the use of water salvaged through the application of water-saving methods to expand irrigation, provided that:

(1) for each source quantified in Article III, any change in use or transfer shall not result in uses that exceed the water amount quantified for that source;


(2) any change in use or transfer shall not result in an increase in net depletion in the Beaver Creek drainage in excess of the amount specified for that source;


(3) any change in use or transfer shall not have an adverse effect on a water right recognized under state law with a priority date before the date of the change or transfer provided that for change in use or transfer of groundwater, the burden as to adverse effect shall be as set forth in Section A.6. of Article IV;  and


(4) any change in use or transfer shall not change the source of the water involved in any such changes.


(5) The Tribe may not make a change in use or transfer of any water rights set forth in Article III for the purposes of stockwatering or fish and wildlife enhancement;  provided that, the Tribe may repair or relocate an impoundment for stockwatering or fish and wildlife enhancement within the drainage of origin;  and provided further that, the new point of diversion or place of use does not change to a place from upstream of to downstream of, or from downstream of to upstream of the location of the point of diversion of a water right recognized under state law with a priority date before the date the Compact is ratified by the State and the Tribe, whichever date is later.


(6) The Tribe may not make a change in use or transfer any of the water rights set forth in Article III with a source on the drainages of Upper Big Sandy Creek, Camp Creek, Duck Creek and Gorman Creek that results in a change in the place of use, point of diversion or place or means of storage of the water outside the drainage of origin or to a place from upstream of to downstream of, or from downstream of to upstream of the location of the point of diversion of a water right recognized under state law with a priority date before the date the Compact is ratified by the State and the Tribe, whichever date is later.


(7) The Tribe may make a change in use or transfer of the irrigation water right with a source in Upper Big Sandy Creek drainage as set forth in Section A.5.e. of Article III so long as it does so within the diversionary limits set forth in Section A.5.d. of Article III;  provided that, the net depletion shall not exceed 30 AFY.



b. Off-Reservation Changes in Use or Transfer of the Tribal Water Right. Except as may be otherwise provided in this Compact, the Tribe, pursuant to federal law, may make or permit a change in use or a transfer of the Tribal Water Right for use off the Reservation;  provided that, any transfer shall be for a term of not to exceed 100 years, and may include provisions authorizing renewal for an additional term of not to exceed 100 years;  and provided further that, no such transfer shall be a permanent alienation of the water transferred;  and provided further that, no transfer or change in place of use shall be made to a location outside the watershed that forms the Missouri River drainage;  and provided further that, if the Tribe receives a good faith offer from a third person from outside the Milk River drainage to acquire use of specified Tribal water rights and the Tribe is willing to accept the terms of the offer, the Tribe, before accepting the offer, shall allow water users in the Milk River drainage the opportunity to acquire use of such rights at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those contained in the offer. Any change in use or transfer of any such water right involving a point of diversion or place of use located off the Reservation shall be considered an off-Reservation use;  provided that, any off-Reservation use of Tribal water rights described in this Compact shall not be deemed to convert such rights to rights arising under state law, and nonuse of such rights off the Reservation shall not constitute a relinquishment, forfeiture, or abandonment of the rights;  and provided further that, releases or diversions from Lake Elwell for use on the Reservation shall not be considered off-Reservation uses. The Tribe may change the point of diversion or purpose or place of use of the Tribal Water Right back to the Reservation without reduction in the amount of water provided in the Compact.

(1) Applicable Law.No person may initiate an off-Reservation use, change in use, or transfer of a Tribal water right set forth in this Compact without first applying for and receiving authorization for the use, change in use, or transfer pursuant to Montana law in effect at the time of the application. Approval of an application for a use, change in use or transfer off the Reservation by the State shall be conditioned on a valid Tribal permit for such use, change in use or transfer by the Tribe. The applicant shall provide DNRC with proof of a valid Tribal permit prior to initiating the use, change in use, or transfer.


(2) Diversion Facilities.With respect to diversion or transportation facilities located off the Reservation which are to be used in connection with the exercise of a water right set forth in this Compact, the Tribe or persons using such water rights shall apply for all permits, certificates, variances and other authorizations required by state laws regulating, conditioning or permitting the siting, construction, operation, alteration or use of any equipment, device, facility or associated facility proposed to use or transport water. A diversion or use of water in the exercise of such water rights may be made only after all permits, certificates, variances or other authorizations applied for pursuant to this paragraph have been obtained.


(3) Subsequent Federal or State Law.All off-Reservation uses of Tribal water rights set forth in this Compact shall comply with the requirements set forth in Section A.4.b.(1) and (2) of Article IV until such time as the statutory or common law of the United States or the State of Montana establish that off-Reservation uses of Indian water rights may occur without regard to state law.



c. Placement and Size Survey. Placement and size of stockwater impoundments and fish and wildlife enhancement areas shall be surveyed by the TWRD every five (5) years commencing one (1) year after the ratification date of this Compact. The initial survey method shall be through use of data obtained by aerial photography or an acceptable quantitative substitute with accuracy and verification equal to or greater than photography. The method may be modified by agreement between the TWRD and the DNRC. Such modification is pursuant to and shall not be deemed a modification of this Compact. The TWRD shall provide the DNRC with a completed survey for review within six (6) months of initiation of the survey.


d. Net Depletion Table. Net depletion for Tribal water uses in the Beaver Creek drainage and for irrigation uses in the Upper Big Sandy Creek drainage shall be as set forth in the table attached as Appendix 9 to this Compact. The TWRD and the DNRC may jointly agree to modify this initial table. Such modification is pursuant to, and will not be deemed a modification of, this Compact.



5. Reporting requirements.

a. On an annual basis the DNRC shall provide the Tribe and the United States with a listing of all new uses of surface and groundwater for which a permit has been issued by the DNRC in the Big Sandy and Beaver Creek drainages, and of any change in use or transfer of surface water or groundwater approved by the DNRC in the Big Sandy and Beaver Creek drainages since the last report.


b. On an annual basis the TWRD shall provide the State and the United States with a listing of all new development of the water rights described in this Compact, the net depletion in the Beaver Creek drainage, and the net depletion for irrigation in the Upper Big Sandy Creek drainage, and of all changes in use or transfers of the water rights described in this Compact since the last report. The first report by the TWRD following adoption of a Tribal Water Code shall include a listing of existing uses.


c. The TWRD, the DNRC, and the United States may agree to modify the reporting requirements set forth in subsections a. and b. of this section. Such modification is pursuant to, and will not be deemed a modification of, this Compact.



6. Groundwater.

a. New Groundwater Development Without Adverse Effect.

(1) Limits on Additional Development of Groundwater from Sources on the Reservation. After the ratification date of this Compact, the Tribe may develop or permit the development of groundwater;  provided that, such development is without an adverse effect on water rights recognized under state law with a priority date before the date of development of the new appropriation.


(2) Prerequisite Administrative Remedy. The following procedure for determining whether new development of groundwater will have an adverse effect on existing groundwater rights recognized under state law shall be followed prior to seeking relief from the Compact Board:

(a) Application for development of a groundwater use on the Reservation shall be made to the TWRD.


(b) The TWRD shall review the application and make a determination of whether the new use will have an adverse effect on existing water rights recognized under state law with a priority date before the application date. Upon request by the TWRD, the DNRC shall provide information on existing state water rights as recorded in the DNRC database to the TWRD.


(c) If the TWRD determines that the new development will have an adverse effect on a water right recognized under state law with a priority date before the application date, the TWRD shall deny the application. If the TWRD determines that the new development will not have an adverse effect on a water right recognized under state law with a priority date before the application date, the TWRD shall forward the application with its determination to the DNRC.


(d) If, based upon the evidence, DNRC agrees with the TWRD's determination, the application will be approved. If, however, based upon the evidence, the DNRC cannot agree with the determination of the TWRD, DNRC shall publish notice, of the application once in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the source and shall serve notice by first-class mail on any appropriator of water or holder of a permit who, according to the records of the department, has a water right with a priority date before the application date, and may be affected by the proposed development.


(e) DNRC and the TWRD shall attempt to resolve any disagreement on the determination of no adverse effect by the TWRD on a cooperative basis. If the DNRC or a holder of a water right recognized under state law with a priority date before the application date disagree with the determination of no adverse effect, DNRC or the water users may seek relief from the Compact Board.


(f) In any proceeding concerning the effect of new groundwater development on the Reservation either before the TWRD, the DNRC, or before the Compact Board, the following shall apply:

(i) 1--150 Feet Wells: For new Tribal groundwater wells completed at a depth beneath the surface of 1 to 150 feet, the Tribe shall bear the burden of showing no adverse effect to groundwater uses recognized under state law with a priority date before the application date.


(ii) 150 Feet or Deeper Wells: For Tribal groundwater wells completed at a depth beneath the surface of 150 feet or deeper, the owner of a water right recognized under state law with a priority date before the application date shall bear the burden of showing any adverse effect to the water right.





b. Groundwater Development Exempt From The Showing Of No Adverse Effect. The following wells are exempt from the requirement of showing no adverse effect:

(1) Existing Tribal wells are exempt from the burden to show no adverse effect. The Tribe may develop existing wells, or replacements therefor, to their full capacity. The primary municipal and domestic wells are listed in Appendix 8. A comprehensive list of existing wells will be kept on file in TWRD offices as per the requirement to list existing uses in Section A.5. of Article IV.


(2) New Tribal groundwater wells producing from the Volcanic Bedrock Aquifer may be developed without a showing of no adverse effect.



c. Ancestral Missouri River Channel Aquifer. Groundwater from the Ancestral Missouri River Channel Aquifer shall be a primary source for non-irrigation uses;  provided that, the non-irrigation uses do not result in discharge of untreated water to land or surface water. Groundwater from the Ancestral Missouri River Channel Aquifer is a supplemental source for irrigation uses.



7. Moratorium.

a. New State Permits. With the exceptions listed in subsection (1) of this section, the DNRC shall not process or grant an application for a permit to appropriate water from a source in the Big Sandy Creek Basin (excluding Sage Creek and Lonesome Lake Coulee), and in the Beaver Creek drainage after the date this Compact is ratified by the Montana Legislature and by the Chippewa Cree Business Committee, whichever date is later. This moratorium shall remain in effect for a minimum of 10 years and shall only be lifted pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section A.7.b of Article IV. This moratorium is not intended to apply to applications for change in appropriation under state law.

(1) The moratorium shall not apply to the following appropriations:

(a) an appropriation of groundwater by means of a well or developed spring with a maximum appropriation of 35 gallons per minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet per year unless the appropriation is a combined appropriation from the same source from two or more wells or developed springs exceeding the limitation;


(b) an appropriation of water for use by livestock if the maximum capacity of the impoundment or pit is less than 15 acre-feet and the appropriation is less than 30 acre-feet per year and is from a source other than a perennial flowing stream;


(c) an appropriation of groundwater from any deep aquifer not hydrologically connected to surface water.



(2) Within 120 days following the date the moratorium takes effect, the DNRC shall publish notice of the moratorium once in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the source and shall serve notice by first-class mail on all appropriators of water or holders of permits who, according to the records of the department, have a water right with a source in the affected drainages.


(3) The moratorium applies only to new permits issued under state law and is not a limit on new development of the Tribal Water Right as set forth in this Compact.



b. Lifting of Moratorium. After 10 years, the Tribe or an individual seeking to appropriate water in the affected drainages may petition the DNRC for removal of the moratorium, or the DNRC may initiate proceedings to lift a moratorium on its own initiative. The DNRC shall comply with the following procedure in making a determination as to whether water is available in excess of the Tribal Water Right and rights recognized under state law. The DNRC and TWRD may agree to modify procedures or provide additional procedures. Such modification is pursuant to and shall not be deemed to be a modification of the Compact.

(1) Proceedings initiated by TWRD.

(a) The TWRD shall have sixty (60) days following the filing of the petition requesting that the moratorium be lifted to provide the DNRC with data supporting its petition to lift the moratorium.


(b) Within sixty (60) days following the receipt of the data supporting TWRD's petition, the DNRC shall determine whether to lift the moratorium, and shall notify the TWRD of its determination and the grounds therefor. The TWRD shall be allowed reasonable access to any data relied upon by the DNRC for its determination.


(c) Within thirty (30) days following a determination by the DNRC not to lift the moratorium, the TWRD may challenge the DNRC's determination in a de novo proceeding before the Compact Board. The moratorium shall continue pending Compact Board proceedings and any appeal



(2) Proceedings initiated by DNRC.

(a) The DNRC may, on request by a water user or on its own initiative, commence proceedings to determine whether to lift a moratorium.


(b) The DNRC shall notify the TWRD of the commencement of proceedings to determine whether to lift the moratorium and shall submit to the TWRD all data in support of the proceedings at the same time or as soon after such data becomes available as practical or shall give the TWRD reasonable access to such data within the same time frame.


(c) The TWRD shall be given sixty (60) days following receipt of the data in support of the proceedings to submit to the DNRC a statement of the Tribe's position concerning the issue along with any supporting data and argument.


(d) The DNRC shall notify the TWRD of its determination and the grounds therefor within sixty (60) days of receipt of the Tribe's statement.


(e) Within thirty (30) days following a determination by the DNRC not to lift the moratorium, the TWRD may challenge the DNRC's determination in a de novo proceeding before the Compact Board. The moratorium shall continue pending Compact Board proceedings and any appeal.




c. Excess Water. If the moratorium is lifted pursuant to the procedure described in A.7.b. of Article IV, the Tribe shall have the first right to use the excess water for the purpose of fulfilling new reserved water rights, if any, on land acquired after the ratification date of this Compact, but before the date the moratorium is lifted. The excess water used by the Tribe shall become part of the Tribal Water Right and the tribe may make a change in use of, or transfer, including storage, of such water pursuant to Section A.4.a. of Article IV.


d. Limit on New Tribal Groundwater Development. In any drainage with a moratorium, new Tribal groundwater development pursuant to Section C.1. of Article III, by a well or developed spring from an aquifer that is hydrologically connected to surface water shall be limited to a maximum appropriation or combined appropriation from two or more wells or developed springs in a single drainage defined by this Compact to 35 gallons per minute or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet per year.



8. Mutual Subordination.To reduce the need for daily administration of water use on and off the Reservation, water rights shall not be administered in priority, but shall be satisfied according to the following agreements.

a. Subordination to Non-Tribal Water Rights Upstream of the Reservation.The Tribal Water Right shall be subordinate to water rights recognized under state law upstream from any point on the Reservation with a priority date before the ratification date of this Compact. It is the intent of the parties that this subordination extends only to valid water rights, and not to statements of claim filed pursuant to 
85-2-221, MCA
. With the exception of rights exempt from filing in the state adjudication pursuant to 
85-2-222, MCA
, and rights exempt from the permit process pursuant to 
85-2-306, MCA
, a list of rights as currently claimed is attached as Appendix 3. Appendix 3 will be modified by any final decree resolving claims on the affected drainages. Appendix 3 may be modified due to clerical error or omission.


b. Effect of Mitigation. Because the impact of development of the Tribal Water Right on downstream water rights recognized under State law has been mitigated by provisions of the Compact and by special measures set forth in drainage stipulations, any person claiming or holding a water right recognized under State law, or an interest in such water right, may not assert priority over, or make a call for, or claim any of the water rights of the Tribe set forth in this Compact, in any court, tribunal, or other forum.



9. Stockwatering Impoundments Limited by Surface Area. Except for new stock ponds developed under Section C.2. of Article III, the surface acreage limitations on stockwatering impoundments set forth in Article III shall be the measure of compliance with the quantification of water rights for the purpose of stockwatering.


10. Impoundments for the Purpose of Enhancing Fish and Wildlife Habitat.

a. Fish and Wildlife Enhancement Impoundments Limited by Surface Area. The surface acreage limitations on impoundments for the purpose of fish and wildlife enhancement set forth in Article III shall be the measure of compliance with the quantification of water rights for the purpose of fish and wildlife enhancement.

8. Mutual Subordination.To reduce the need for daily administration of water use on and off the Reservation, water rights shall not be administered in priority, but shall be satisfied according to the following agreements.

a. Subordination to Non-Tribal Water Rights Upstream of the Reservation.The Tribal Water Right shall be subordinate to water rights recognized under state law upstream from any point on the Reservation with a priority date before the ratification date of this Compact. It is the intent of the parties that this subordination extends only to valid water rights, and not to statements of claim filed pursuant to 
85-2-221, MCA
. With the exception of rights exempt from filing in the state adjudication pursuant to 
85-2-222, MCA
, and rights exempt from the permit process pursuant to 
85-2-306, MCA
, a list of rights as currently claimed is attached as Appendix 3. Appendix 3 will be modified by any final decree resolving claims on the affected drainages. Appendix 3 may be modified due to clerical error or omission.


b. Effect of Mitigation. Because the impact of development of the Tribal Water Right on downstream water rights recognized under State law has been mitigated by provisions of the Compact and by special measures set forth in drainage stipulations, any person claiming or holding a water right recognized under State law, or an interest in such water right, may not assert priority over, or make a call for, or claim any of the water rights of the Tribe set forth in this Compact, in any court, tribunal, or other forum.

B. Big Sandy Creek Basin.

1. Operation of Bonneau Reservoir.

a. Minimum Pool/240 AFY Stored for Satisfaction of Release. The minimum pool at Bonneau Reservoir shall be established by the Tribe. The Tribe shall store annually the minimum pool plus 240 acre-feet, if water is available. The 240 acre-feet above the minimum pool shall be stored to satisfy the release set forth in this Article and shall not be available to satisfy the Tribal Water Right. Evaporative loss shall be accounted for in setting the minimum pool and shall not be subtracted from the 240 acre-foot pool stored for downstream water users. Any change in use of the water stored in Bonneau Reservoir from irrigation to other purposes shall be without adverse effect on downstream water uses recognized under state law with a priority date before the date of change, and measures to prevent adverse effect may include release of additional water from Bonneau Reservoir.


b. Release for Off-Reservation Irrigation Use. The Tribe shall release no more than 104 AFY from Bonneau Reservoir or from direct flow of Box Elder Creek to satisfy the claims for irrigation water rights currently held by Bert Corcoran, and the Tribe shall deliver this water to a point of diversion specified in the drainage stipulation between the Tribe and Mr. Corcoran attached as part of Appendix 2;  provided that, the Tribe shall have no responsibility to upgrade or to increase the capacity of the existing delivery system;  and further provided that, the Tribe shall not be required to release water from Bonneau Reservoir below the minimum pool established by the Tribe plus 240 acre-feet prior to satisfaction of the 240 acre-feet per year release set forth in Section B.1.c. of Article IV, and the minimum pool at all other times. The 104 AFY release shall be in accordance with a delivery schedule agreed to by Mr. Corcoran, or his successors in interest, and the TWRD. Mr. Corcoran's claims for irrigation water rights shall be specified in the drainage stipulation between the Tribe and Mr. Corcoran attached as part of Appendix 2. Nothing in the drainage stipulation or in this Compact shall affect any existing right that Mr. Corcoran may have to the use of on-Reservation conveyance and distribution systems to deliver this water.


c. 240 AFY Release. The Tribe shall annually release the first 240 acre-feet of water, as measured near the confluence of Box Elder Creek and Lower Big Sandy Creek, stored in Bonneau Reservoir above the minimum pool, at the request of the downstream irrigation water users as set forth below, for maintenance of instream flow and for domestic and stock purposes on Lower Big Sandy Creek. The 240 AF of water, once released, shall be designated as an instream flow and shall be senior to all Tribal diversions and all non-domestic and non-stockwater rights recognized under state law from the point of release to the confluence with the Milk River. The Tribe shall not divert from direct flow on Lower Big Sandy Creek between its confluence with Box Elder Creek and the Reservation boundary at Stoneman Farms, as that boundary exists on the effective date of this Compact, during release of the 240 AF of water to downstream water users in the months of July and August. A structure that will bypass the peak scheduled release will be constructed for any diversion of the Tribal Water Right upstream of the confluence of Big Sandy Creek with Gravel Coulee. Under no circumstances shall the Tribe be required to release more than 240 AFY of water to maintain instream flow and for domestic and stock purposes.


d. Schedule for 240 AFY. The method for determining the schedule of releases is as follows: Water users on Lower Big Sandy Creek with drainage stipulations listed in Appendix 2 shall elect a three member Bonneau Release Committee to determine the schedule of release for the 240 AFY. The Committee shall notify the DNRC which shall notify the TWRD by May 1st of each year of the requested schedule. The schedule shall not exceed the operating standards of Bonneau Reservoir or result in unreasonable interference of the Tribe's use of water stored in the Reservoir. If the TWRD does not receive notice by May 1 of any year, the TWRD shall release 2 cfs continuously for July and August in accordance with Section B.1.c. of Article IV. DNRC shall notify water users which, according to the records of the Department, have a water right recognized under state law with a source on Box Elder Creek, or on Big Sandy Creek between the confluence with Box Elder Creek and the confluence with the Milk River, that the release may not be diverted. After May 1, at the request of the Bonneau Release Committee, the DNRC shall request the Tribe to alter the rate of release and the Tribe may agree to comply. At the request of the Tribe, the DNRC shall request the Bonneau Release Committee to agree to forego the release, and if the Committee believes the purposes for the release as set forth in Section B.1.c. of Article IV are being satisfied without the release, the Committee may, in any year, agree to forego the release. When streamflow in lower Big Sandy Creek at the bypass structure referred to in Section B.1.c. of Article IV, exceeds the peak flow specified in the designated release schedule, such excess flow can be diverted by the Tribe, subject to the diversion limits designated in Article III.


e. Effective Date for Bonneau Reservoir Operational Plan.Notwithstanding ratification of this Compact by the parties, the operational plan for Bonneau Reservoir set forth in Sections B.1.a. through c. of Article IV, shall not become effective until completion of the enlargement of Bonneau Dam.



2. Water Use on Lower Big Sandy Creek Drainage.

a. 2 cfs Bypass at Stoneman Farms. Structures will be constructed at each point of diversion on Lower Big Sandy Creek which allow a minimum of 2 cfs of water flow from direct and return flow, if available, to pass year around from the most downstream diversion on the Reservation on Lower Big Sandy Creek. The 2 cfs shall be designated as an instream flow and shall be senior in priority to Tribal diversions and all non-domestic and non-stockwatering water rights recognized under state law with a point of diversion between the bypass and the confluence with the Milk River. When streamflow in Lower Big Sandy Creek exceeds 2 cfs outside the scheduled 240 AF release period, such excess flow can be diverted by the Tribe subject to diversion limits designated in Article III.


b. Water Quality Issues.

(1) Monitoring Wells.Within one year following the effective date of this Compact, a monitoring well network adequate to detect saline seep shall be installed to depths no greater than 30 feet near the proposed Enlarged Stoneman Reservoir site shown in Appendix 6. The location of the wells will be established by TWRD and DNRC (or its representative) and groundwater level and quality shall be measured on a quarterly basis to establish baseline conditions.


(2) Water Quality Monitoring Before Construction. Within one year following the effective date of this Compact, a surface water quality network will be established by TWRD and DNRC and quarterly sampling continued for a sufficient period of time to establish the water quality baseline conditions referred to above, adjacent to and below the Stoneman Farms project. The results of the baseline analysis will be used to establish a threshold value for water quality degradation associated with salinity which will trigger the requirement for more extensive study.


(3) Water Quality Monitoring After Construction.After construction of the Stoneman Reservoir enlargement, monitoring of the wells and surface water quality will be resumed to evaluate changes in water quality. If salinity measurements result in a trend of increasing salinity on a sustained basis over a reasonable period of time, the TWRD or DNRC may petition the Compact Board to appoint a technical expert to conduct an analysis to identify the causes of the increasing salinity and recommend appropriate remedies. The analysis and recommendations may include sources of salinity off the Reservation.


(4) Remedies.The results of the analysis shall be submitted to the DNRC and to the TWRD which shall make a joint effort to resolve the degradation issue based on the analyses. If the analysis includes sources of salinity off the Reservation, the DNRC shall assist the TWRD in obtaining reasonable access onto the land off the Reservation for the purpose of observation. If the DNRC and the TWRD, are unable to resolve the issue within 30 days through joint effort, the DNRC, the TWRD, or any affected water user, may petition the Compact Board for relief. The Compact Board shall have jurisdiction over any contributor to the salinity problem and shall fashion its remedy in a manner proportionate to the causes contributing to the problem. The remedy fashioned by the Compact Board for salinity problems shall be limited to issuance of an order to cease and desist the practice or practices leading to the salinity problems. The remedies set forth in this section shall be in addition to any remedies or water quality standards provided for under other applicable law.





1. Operation of Bonneau Reservoir.

a. Minimum Pool/240 AFY Stored for Satisfaction of Release. The minimum pool at Bonneau Reservoir shall be established by the Tribe. The Tribe shall store annually the minimum pool plus 240 acre-feet, if water is available. The 240 acre-feet above the minimum pool shall be stored to satisfy the release set forth in this Article and shall not be available to satisfy the Tribal Water Right. Evaporative loss shall be accounted for in setting the minimum pool and shall not be subtracted from the 240 acre-foot pool stored for downstream water users. Any change in use of the water stored in Bonneau Reservoir from irrigation to other purposes shall be without adverse effect on downstream water uses recognized under state law with a priority date before the date of change, and measures to prevent adverse effect may include release of additional water from Bonneau Reservoir.


b. Release for Off-Reservation Irrigation Use. The Tribe shall release no more than 104 AFY from Bonneau Reservoir or from direct flow of Box Elder Creek to satisfy the claims for irrigation water rights currently held by Bert Corcoran, and the Tribe shall deliver this water to a point of diversion specified in the drainage stipulation between the Tribe and Mr. Corcoran attached as part of Appendix 2;  provided that, the Tribe shall have no responsibility to upgrade or to increase the capacity of the existing delivery system;  and further provided that, the Tribe shall not be required to release water from Bonneau Reservoir below the minimum pool established by the Tribe plus 240 acre-feet prior to satisfaction of the 240 acre-feet per year release set forth in Section B.1.c. of Article IV, and the minimum pool at all other times. The 104 AFY release shall be in accordance with a delivery schedule agreed to by Mr. Corcoran, or his successors in interest, and the TWRD. Mr. Corcoran's claims for irrigation water rights shall be specified in the drainage stipulation between the Tribe and Mr. Corcoran attached as part of Appendix 2.

c. 240 AFY Release. The Tribe shall annually release the first 240 acre-feet of water, as measured near the confluence of Box Elder Creek and Lower Big Sandy Creek, stored in Bonneau Reservoir above the minimum pool, at the request of the downstream irrigation water users as set forth below, for maintenance of instream flow and for domestic and stock purposes on Lower Big Sandy Creek. The 240 AF of water, once released, shall be designated as an instream flow and shall be senior to all Tribal diversions and all non-domestic and non-stockwater rights recognized under state law from the point of release to the confluence with the Milk River. The Tribe shall not divert from direct flow on Lower Big Sandy Creek between its confluence with Box Elder Creek and the Reservation boundary at Stoneman Farms, as that boundary exists on the effective date of this Compact, during release of the 240 AF of water to downstream water users in the months of July and August. A structure that will bypass the peak scheduled release will be constructed for any diversion of the Tribal Water Right upstream of the confluence of Big Sandy Creek with Gravel Coulee. Under no circumstances shall the Tribe be required to release more than 240 AFY of water to maintain instream flow and for domestic and stock purposes.


d. Schedule for 240 AFY. The method for determining the schedule of releases is as follows: Water users on Lower Big Sandy Creek with drainage stipulations listed in Appendix 2 shall elect a three member Bonneau Release Committee to determine the schedule of release for the 240 AFY. The Committee shall notify the DNRC which shall notify the TWRD by May 1st of each year of the requested schedule. The schedule shall not exceed the operating standards of Bonneau Reservoir or result in unreasonable interference of the Tribe's use of water stored in the Reservoir. If the TWRD does not receive notice by May 1 of any year, the TWRD shall release 2 cfs continuously for July and August in accordance with Section B.1.c. of Article IV. DNRC shall notify water users which, according to the records of the Department, have a water right recognized under state law with a source on Box Elder Creek, or on Big Sandy Creek between the confluence with Box Elder Creek and the confluence with the Milk River, that the release may not be diverted. After May 1, at the request of the Bonneau Release Committee, the DNRC shall request the Tribe to alter the rate of release and the Tribe may agree to comply. At the request of the Tribe, the DNRC shall request the Bonneau Release Committee to agree to forego the release, and if the Committee believes the purposes for the release as set forth in Section B.1.c. of Article IV are being satisfied without the release, the Committee may, in any year, agree to forego the release. When streamflow in lower Big Sandy Creek at the bypass structure referred to in Section B.1.c. of Article IV, exceeds the peak flow specified in the designated release schedule, such excess flow can be diverted by the Tribe, subject to the diversion limits designated in Article III.


e. Effective Date for Bonneau Reservoir Operational Plan.Notwithstanding ratification of this Compact by the parties, the operational plan for Bonneau Reservoir set forth in Sections B.1.a. through c. of Article IV, shall not become effective until completion of the enlargement of Bonneau Dam.



a. Minimum Pool/240 AFY Stored for Satisfaction of Release. The minimum pool at Bonneau Reservoir shall be established by the Tribe. The Tribe shall store annually the minimum pool plus 240 acre-feet, if water is available. The 240 acre-feet above the minimum pool shall be stored to satisfy the release set forth in this Article and shall not be available to satisfy the Tribal Water Right. Evaporative loss shall be accounted for in setting the minimum pool and shall not be subtracted from the 240 acre-foot pool stored for downstream water users. Any change in use of the water stored in Bonneau Reservoir from irrigation to other purposes shall be without adverse effect on downstream water uses recognized under state law with a priority date before the date of change, and measures to prevent adverse effect may include release of additional water from Bonneau Reservoir.


b. Release for Off-Reservation Irrigation Use. The Tribe shall release no more than 104 AFY from Bonneau Reservoir or from direct flow of Box Elder Creek to satisfy the claims for irrigation water rights currently held by Bert Corcoran, and the Tribe shall deliver this water to a point of diversion specified in the drainage stipulation between the Tribe and Mr. Corcoran attached as part of Appendix 2;  provided that, the Tribe shall have no responsibility to upgrade or to increase the capacity of the existing delivery system;  and further provided that, the Tribe shall not be required to release water from Bonneau Reservoir below the minimum pool established by the Tribe plus 240 acre-feet prior to satisfaction of the 240 acre-feet per year release set forth in Section B.1.c. of Article IV, and the minimum pool at all other times. The 104 AFY release shall be in accordance with a delivery schedule agreed to by Mr. Corcoran, or his successors in interest, and the TWRD. Mr. Corcoran's claims for irrigation water rights shall be specified in the drainage stipulation between the Tribe and Mr. Corcoran attached as part of Appendix 2. Nothing in the drainage stipulation or in this Compact shall affect any existing right that Mr. Corcoran may have to the use of on-Reservation conveyance and distribution systems to deliver this water.


c. 240 AFY Release. The Tribe shall annually release the first 240 acre-feet of water, as measured near the confluence of Box Elder Creek and Lower Big Sandy Creek, stored in Bonneau Reservoir above the minimum pool, at the request of the downstream irrigation water users as set forth below, for maintenance of instream flow and for domestic and stock purposes on Lower Big Sandy Creek. The 240 AF of water, once released, shall be designated as an instream flow and shall be senior to all Tribal diversions and all non-domestic and non-stockwater rights recognized under state law from the point of release to the confluence with the Milk River. The Tribe shall not divert from direct flow on Lower Big Sandy Creek between its confluence with Box Elder Creek and the Reservation boundary at Stoneman Farms, as that boundary exists on the effective date of this Compact, during release of the 240 AF of water to downstream water users in the months of July and August. A structure that will bypass the peak scheduled release will be constructed for any diversion of the Tribal Water Right upstream of the confluence of Big Sandy Creek with Gravel Coulee. Under no circumstances shall the Tribe be required to release more than 240 AFY of water to maintain instream flow and for domestic and stock purposes.


d. Schedule for 240 AFY. The method for determining the schedule of releases is as follows: Water users on Lower Big Sandy Creek with drainage stipulations listed in Appendix 2 shall elect a three member Bonneau Release Committee to determine the schedule of release for the 240 AFY. The Committee shall notify the DNRC which shall notify the TWRD by May 1st of each year of the requested schedule. The schedule shall not exceed the operating standards of Bonneau Reservoir or result in unreasonable interference of the Tribe's use of water stored in the Reservoir. If the TWRD does not receive notice by May 1 of any year, the TWRD shall release 2 cfs continuously for July and August in accordance with Section B.1.c. of Article IV. DNRC shall notify water users which, according to the records of the Department, have a water right recognized under state law with a source on Box Elder Creek, or on Big Sandy Creek between the confluence with Box Elder Creek and the confluence with the Milk River, that the release may not be diverted. After May 1, at the request of the Bonneau Release Committee, the DNRC shall request the Tribe to alter the rate of release and the Tribe may agree to comply. At the request of the Tribe, the DNRC shall request the Bonneau Release Committee to agree to forego the release, and if the Committee believes the purposes for the release as set forth in Section B.1.c. of Article IV are being satisfied without the release, the Committee may, in any year, agree to forego the release. When streamflow in lower Big Sandy Creek at the bypass structure referred to in Section B.1.c. of Article IV, exceeds the peak flow specified in the designated release schedule, such excess flow can be diverted by the Tribe, subject to the diversion limits designated in Article III.


e. Effective Date for Bonneau Reservoir Operational Plan.Notwithstanding ratification of this Compact by the parties, the operational plan for Bonneau Reservoir set forth in Sections B.1.a. through c. of Article IV, shall not become effective until completion of the enlargement of Bonneau Dam.


2. Water Use on Lower Big Sandy Creek Drainage.

a. 2 cfs Bypass at Stoneman Farms. Structures will be constructed at each point of diversion on Lower Big Sandy Creek which allow a minimum of 2 cfs of water flow from direct and return flow, if available, to pass year around from the most downstream diversion on the Reservation on Lower Big Sandy Creek. The 2 cfs shall be designated as an instream flow and shall be senior in priority to Tribal diversions and all non-domestic and non-stockwatering water rights recognized under state law with a point of diversion between the bypass and the confluence with the Milk River. When streamflow in Lower Big Sandy Creek exceeds 2 cfs outside the scheduled 240 AF release period, such excess flow can be diverted by the Tribe subject to diversion limits designated in Article III.


b. Water Quality Issues.

(1) Monitoring Wells.Within one year following the effective date of this Compact, a monitoring well network adequate to detect saline seep shall be installed to depths no greater than 30 feet near the proposed Enlarged Stoneman Reservoir site shown in Appendix 6. The location of the wells will be established by TWRD and DNRC (or its representative) and groundwater level and quality shall be measured on a quarterly basis to establish baseline conditions.


(2) Water Quality Monitoring Before Construction. Within one year following the effective date of this Compact, a surface water quality network will be established by TWRD and DNRC and quarterly sampling continued for a sufficient period of time to establish the water quality baseline conditions referred to above, adjacent to and below the Stoneman Farms project. The results of the baseline analysis will be used to establish a threshold value for water quality degradation associated with salinity which will trigger the requirement for more extensive study.


(3) Water Quality Monitoring After Construction.After construction of the Stoneman Reservoir enlargement, monitoring of the wells and surface water quality will be resumed to evaluate changes in water quality. If salinity measurements result in a trend of increasing salinity on a sustained basis over a reasonable period of time, the TWRD or DNRC may petition the Compact Board to appoint a technical expert to conduct an analysis to identify the causes of the increasing salinity and recommend appropriate remedies. The analysis and recommendations may include sources of salinity off the Reservation.


(4) Remedies.The results of the analysis shall be submitted to the DNRC and to the TWRD which shall make a joint effort to resolve the degradation issue based on the analyses. If the analysis includes sources of salinity off the Reservation, the DNRC shall assist the TWRD in obtaining reasonable access onto the land off the Reservation for the purpose of observation. If the DNRC and the TWRD, are unable to resolve the issue within 30 days through joint effort, the DNRC, the TWRD, or any affected water user, may petition the Compact Board for relief. The Compact Board shall have jurisdiction over any contributor to the salinity problem and shall fashion its remedy in a manner proportionate to the causes contributing to the problem. The remedy fashioned by the Compact Board for salinity problems shall be limited to issuance of an order to cease and desist the practice or practices leading to the salinity problems. The remedies set forth in this section shall be in addition to any remedies or water quality standards provided for under other applicable law.




a. 2 cfs Bypass at Stoneman Farms. Structures will be constructed at each point of diversion on Lower Big Sandy Creek which allow a minimum of 2 cfs of water flow from direct and return flow, if available, to pass year around from the most downstream diversion on the Reservation on Lower Big Sandy Creek. The 2 cfs shall be designated as an instream flow and shall be senior in priority to Tribal diversions and all non-domestic and non-stockwatering water rights recognized under state law with a point of diversion between the bypass and the confluence with the Milk River. When streamflow in Lower Big Sandy Creek exceeds 2 cfs outside the scheduled 240 AF release period, such excess flow can be diverted by the Tribe subject to diversion limits designated in Article III.

ARTICLE II


IMPLEMENTATION


A. Abstract:
Concurrent with this Compact, the parties have prepared an Abstract, a copy of which is referenced as Appendix 1, which is a specific listing of all of the United States' water rights [for Big Hole National Battlefield, Glacier National Park, and Yellowstone National Park, and] prepared an Abstract, a copy of which is referenced as Appendix 2, which is a specific listing of all of the United States' water rights for Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area and the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument that are described in this Compact and quantified in accordance with this Compact. The parties prepared the Abstract to comply with the requirements for a final decree as set forth in 
85-2-234(4)
 and 
(7), MCA
, and in an effort to assist the state courts in the process of entering decrees accurately and comprehensively reflecting the rights described in this Compact. The rights specified in the Abstract are subject to the terms of this Compact. In the event of a discrepancy between a right listed in the Abstract and that same right as quantified in accordance with Articles II and III of this Compact, the parties intend that the quantification in accordance with Articles II and III of this Compact shall be reflected in a final decree.


B. Method of Allocation of Water on Category 3 and 4 Streams and of Determining Rights Subject to Curtailment on the Little Bighorn River and its Tributaries:
This section explains the method of quantification of the reserved instream flow water rights of the United States for Category 3 and 4 streams and the method of calculating the quantity of consumptive use pursuant to state law within a basin to which the United States agrees to subordinate its reserved instream flow water right. The method set forth in this section shall be used to determine whether the limits on consumptive use pursuant to state law set forth in Article III have been reached and whether a water right on the Little Bighorn River and its tributaries upstream from the LBBNM shall be subject to curtailment to satisfy the reserved instream flow water right for LBBNM. Addition to the Abstract of a reserved instream flow water right on a stream inadvertently omitted by the parties or reclassification of a stream due to a water right recognized under state law and inadvertently omitted by the parties shall be consistent with this section and shall not be deemed a modification of this Compact.

1. Allocation to Instream Flow:

With the exception of the reserved instream flow rights for LBBNM, the allocation of water to instream flow on Category 3 and 4 streams is arrived at using the following method as explained in general terms:

a. The United States' reserved water right for instream flow includes the entire flow of that stream within the State of Montana at the point where the stream flows over or forms the boundary of the specified reserved land after: (1) all consumptive use water rights of any agency of the United States recognized under federal or state law are satisfied;  and (2) subordination of the reserved water right for instream flow to water rights recognized under state law as set forth in and limited by Article III and more specifically in the Abstract.


b. Actual use of water in Wyoming or Canada shall not diminish the quantity of water designated for consumptive use pursuant to state law as set forth in Article III.

2. Method of Calculation of Consumptive Use Rights Recognized Under State Law:


To determine whether water is available for appropriation for consumptive use pursuant to state law on Category 3 and 4 streams, and for determining whether the limit on subordination of the United States' water rights to consumptive uses has been reached, the following provisions shall apply:

a. Tributary Water: The calculation of total consumptive use on a Category 3 or 4 stream shall include all current and future consumptive use, recognized under state law, of surface water tributary to the stream to the point it enters the reserved land. The limits on total consumptive use on a Category 4 stream that forms the boundary of the reserved land shall include all current and future consumptive use recognized under state law, of surface water tributary to the stream to the most downstream point that the stream forms the boundary of the reserved land.


b. Groundwater: [The following sections i., ii., and iii. shall apply to BHNB, GNP, and YNP.] The following sections iii. and iv. shall apply to BCNRA. The following sections iii. and v. shall apply to LBBNM.

i. An exemption from state permit requirements for wells or developed springs shall not apply to appropriations within a basin tributary to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream after the effective date of this Compact, provided that the registration process set forth in Article II, section B.2.b.ii.(3)(b) shall apply to applications for a permit for a well of 35 gpm or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet per year. In addition, all groundwater appropriations within the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area shall be subject to Article IV.


ii. The calculation of total consumptive use on a Category 3 or 4 stream shall include appropriations of groundwater as follows:

(1) Pre-January 1, 1993: An appropriation of groundwater with a priority date before January 1, 1993, shall not be included in the calculation of total consumptive use.


(2) January 1, 1993--Effective Date: An appropriation of groundwater with a priority date on or after January 1, 1993, but before the effective date of this Compact shall be included in the calculation of total consumptive use if the following procedural requirements are met and the appropriation is found to be hydrologically connected to surface water tributary to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream.

(a) Within 120 days after the effective date of this Compact, the Department shall provide the United States with notice of all groundwater appropriations in drainages tributary to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream that, according to the records of the Department, have a priority date on or after January 1, 1993 and before the effective date of this Compact.


(b) Up to 120 days following mailing of such notice the United States shall provide the Department with credible information that a groundwater appropriation included in the notice is hydrologically connected to surface flow tributary to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream.


(c) Within 60 days of receipt of such information, the Department shall issue an order stating that (1) the appropriation is hydrologically connected to surface water tributary to the Category 3 or 4 stream;  and (2) the action to be taken with respect to the appropriation. The order is effective within 60 days of issuance unless the appropriator enters an appearance to contest the order. If credible information of hydrologic connection has not been provided by the United States, the Department shall issue an order stating its determination and reasons therefore.


(d) If the appropriator enters an appearance to contest the order, the Department shall (1) issue an order staying use of the appropriation pending a final decision on the matter by the Department only if the limits on total consumptive use for that drainage have been reached;  (2) set a date for a hearing;  and (3) proceed pursuant to the provisions for a contested case under the Montana Administrative Procedures Act, Title 2, Chapter 4, of the Montana Code Annotated, provided that the burden of proving hydrologic connection shall be as set forth in Article II, section B.2.b.[ii.](3). The Department shall, whenever possible, consolidate any proceedings on the groundwater application pursuant to Article IV with any proceeding made necessary by this Article.



(3) Post-Effective Date: An appropriation of groundwater recognized under state law with a priority date after the effective date of this Compact shall be included in the calculation of total consumptive use if the following conditions apply:

(a) Wells in excess of 35 gallons per minute or 10 acre-feet per year: The limit on total consumptive use shall include groundwater appropriation by a well or developed spring with a permit amount in excess of 35 gpm or any well with a volume of use greater than 10 acre-feet per year, including a combined appropriation from the same source from two or more wells or developed springs that exceeds these limitations, unless the applicant is able to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the appropriation is not hydrologically connected to surface flow tributary to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream.

(i) The applicant shall submit credible information, including a report to the Department prepared by a professional qualified in the science of groundwater hydrology verifying that the appropriation is not hydrologically connected to surface flow tributary to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream.

(iii) As long as the limit on consumptive use rights for a Category 3 or 4 stream has not been reached, the calculation of total consumptive use shall not include groundwater appropriations by well or a developed spring of 35 gallons per minute or less that do not exceed 10 acre feet per year unless the United States shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed appropriation is hydrologically connected to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream. If the United States meets this burden, the Department shall include the appropriation in the calculation of total consumptive use.


(iv) After the limit on consumptive use rights has been reached on a particular stream, the necessary showing by the United States' shall be to file an objection and come forward with credible information showing that the proposed appropriation is hydrologically connected to surface flows tributary to the reserved portion of the Category 3 or 4 stream. If the United States makes such a showing, the Department shall consider the application under the criteria in Article II, section B.2.b.[ii.](3)(b)(v) and (vi).

At each stage in an adjudication, the allocation to current use as set forth in Article III and more specifically in the Abstract shall be adjusted to reflect the decreed amount.


d. Abandonment: When a consumptive use right recognized under state law on a Category 3 or 4 stream is abandoned and such abandonment causes water to become available for appropriation within the limits of the total amounts of water allocated to consumptive use rights recognized under state law established for that stream by Article III, the increment of water below that limit is available for new appropriation in accordance with state law and this Compact. State law governs the issue of whether an abandonment has occurred.


e. Non-Consumptive Use: The limit on total consumptive use rights recognized under state law shall not include non-consumptive uses as defined by this Compact.



C. Subordination of Instream Flow Right:

1. The United States agrees to subordinate its reserved water right for instream flow to consumptive uses calculated according to this Article in a manner that is specific to each stream on which a reserved water right is described.

, nor shall any claimant of such forfeited water right have standing, based solely on such claimed right, to object to this Compact or any reserved water right described in this Compact, provided that water allocated to future consumptive use pursuant to Article III[B.] of this Compact may be used to satisfy claims filed pursuant to 
85-2-221(3), MCA
 in order of priority.



D. Location of Instream Flow Rights: The United States' reserved water rights for instream flow apply to the portion of the Categories 1 through 4 streams specified in this Compact that flow over or form the boundary to reserved land administered by the National Park Service.


E. Change in Instream Flow Right: Except as provided in Article II, section J.2.b., the water rights dedicated to instream flow by this Compact shall not be changed to any other use.


F. Prohibition on Future Impoundments: With the exception of the North Fork of the Big Hole River and its tributaries, no new impoundments may be permitted on the mainstem of a Category 2, 3, or 4 stream upstream of, or along, the portion of the stream for which a water right for instream flow is described in this Compact [and] no new impoundments may be permitted on the mainstem of the Little Bighorn River in Montana upstream of the LBBNM after the effective date of this Compact. This prohibition shall include impoundments that are exempt from permit requirements under state law. Reclamation, repair or rehabilitation of an existing impoundment shall not be considered a new impoundment, provided that without the consent of the United States, reclamation, repair or rehabilitation shall not cause the impoundment to exceed the original constructed capacity of the impoundment. This prohibition shall not apply to impoundments constructed to store a Tribal water right or to implement settlement of litigation regarding quantification of a Tribal water right. On Category 3 and 4 streams for which an instream flow right is described for periods of low flow as set forth in Article III, sections G.3.c. and d., such water right has not been subordinated to a new water right with the method of diversion as an impoundment on the mainstem of the stream with a priority date on or after January 1, 1993, but before the effective date of this Compact.


G. Management to Maximize Use by Montana Water Users of the Water Allocated to Consumptive Use Rights Recognized Under State Law: If any type of conservation or water distribution plan which includes measurement of actual water use, including use pursuant to rights recognized under state law with a priority date before January 1, 1993, [with respect to BHNB, GNP, and YNP and] before the effective date of this compact [with respect to BCNRA and LBBNM], is adopted pursuant to state law, the limits established for consumptive use appropriated pursuant to state law shall apply to actual measured use, not permitted and decreed or claimed rights, provided that records of actual use be made available to the United States on request and provided further that, such plan shall not diminish the reserved water right of the United States as described in this Compact.


H. Basin Closure

1. Except as provided in Article II, section B.2.d., in the following drainage basins upstream of the portion of the stream for which a reserved water right for instream flow is described in this Compact, the Department shall not process or grant an application or registration for a permit to appropriate or to reserve water for future consumptive use as defined by this Compact once the limits on consumptive use tabulated in Article III and set forth more specifically in the Abstract are reached:

Big Hole National Battlefield:
North Fork of the Big Hole River
Big Horn Canyon National Recreation Area:
Dry Head, Deadman, Davis and Layout Creeks
Glacier National Park:
North Fork of the Flathead River
Middle Fork of the Flathead River
Yellowstone National Park:
Bacon Rind, Buffalo, Cottonwood, Coyote, Hellroaring, Little Cottonwood, Snowslide, Crevice, Dry Canyon, Slough, Tepee, and Soda Butte Creeks, and the Gallatin, Madison, and Yellowstone Rivers

2. If a temporary or permanent basin closure is enacted under state law for a drainage basin or subbasin for which future consumptive water use is limited under this Compact, the most restrictive measures applicable to consumptive use of surface or groundwater shall control.



I. Enforcement of Water Right

1. The United States, the state, or the holder of a water right recognized under state law, may petition a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction for relief when a controversy arises between the United States' reserved water right described by this Compact, and a holder of a water right recognized under state law. Resolution of the controversy shall be governed by the terms of this Compact where applicable, or to the extent not applicable, by applicable state or federal law.


2. The United States agrees that a water commissioner appointed by a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction, or other official authorized by future changes in law, may enter a federal reservation for which a water right is described in this Compact for the purpose of data collection, including the collection of information necessary for water distribution on or off the federal reservation, and to inspect structures for the diversion and measurement of water described in this Compact for consumptive use and for the measurement of instream flow. The terms of entry shall be as specified in an order of a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction.


3. The Department or the Bureau may enter a federal enclave for which a reserved water right is described in this Compact, at a reasonable hour of the day, for the purposes of data collection on water diversion and stream flow or inspection of devices maintained by the United States pursuant to this Compact. The Department or Bureau shall notify the United States by certified mail or in person, at least 24 hours prior to entry.


4. The United States may request an investigation by the Department of a diversion located upstream of the reserved portion of a stream for which a reserved water right is described in this Compact. The Department may investigate. If an investigation occurs, the United States may accompany the Department.


5. The United States shall maintain structures, including wellhead equipment and casing, for the diversion and measurement of water authorized for consumptive use by this Compact. The United States shall maintain the devices it deems necessary for enforcement of its reserved water right for instream flow described in this Compact. The United States shall install and maintain a rated gauge to measure instream flows in the Little Bighorn River. The gauge on the Little Bighorn River shall be on the reach of the river which forms the boundary of the LBBNM, the exact location of which shall be at the discretion of the NPS. The NPS shall resurvey the channel cross section as necessary to maintain gauge accuracy, but in any event not less frequently than every three (3) years. The United States may not seek curtailment of junior water uses unless the channel has been resurveyed within three (3) years of the date on which curtailment is sought.


6. A person who violates or refuses or neglects to comply with the provisions of this Compact, an order of the Department pursuant to this Compact, or an action by the Bureau pursuant to this Compact is subject to the penalties provided by state law, including but not limited to, revocation of a permit issued pursuant to Article IV after the effective date of this Compact.


7. For any appeal to state court of an administrative decision authorized by this Compact, venue shall be the First Judicial District in Helena and the review shall be conducted according to the procedures for judicial review of contested cases under the Montana Administrative Procedures Act, Title 2, Chapter 4, of the Montana Code Annotated.


8. In any contested case proceeding held under the Montana Administrative Procedures Act, Title 2, Chapter 4, of the Montana Code Annotated, pursuant to this Compact, the common law and statutory rules of evidence shall apply only upon stipulation of all parties to a proceeding.



J. Change in Use

1. Change in Use Defined: For the purpose of this Article, the following actions affecting the use of a reserved water right for consumptive use described in this Compact shall be considered a change in use:

a. An action that alters type of use, place of use, point of diversion, place or means of storage, period of use or point of return flow that will:

i. increase the net depletion on a source;  or


ii. adversely affect water quality at the point the reserved water right ends;  or


iii. result in a change in point of diversion or point of return flow relative to a holder of a water right recognized under state law;  or


iv. change the point of diversion from groundwater to surface water, or from surface to groundwater;  or


v. in any other manner, adversely affects the reasonable exercise of a water right that is recognized under state law.



b. The exercise of a reserved water right to future consumptive use as authorized by this Compact shall not be considered a change in use.



2. Instream flow: Reserved water rights specified in this Compact for instream flow shall not be subject to change to any other use, provided that:

a. the emergency use of water for fire suppression as provided for in Article III.H. shall not be deemed a change or alteration in use, or violation of a reserved water right for instream flow;  and


b. the United States may seek to appropriate water for a consumptive use on a source for which no consumptive use is described in this Compact by seeking a permit under state law for consumptive use, provided that the water right granted shall not be counted against the limits on allocation for state consumptive use water rights imposed by this Compact. The water right so acquired shall be administered in accordance with Article V, section B.



3. Consumptive uses: The United States may take action affecting the use of its consumptive use water rights provided that (1) the action shall be in fulfillment of the purposes of the reservation;  (2) the total use shall not exceed the amount described in this Compact;  and (3) the action shall not adversely affect a water right that is recognized under state law.


4. Notice of intent to change use: At least 180 days prior to a change in use, the United States agrees to provide notice to the Department.

a. The notice shall contain the facts pertinent to the proposed change including, where applicable:

7. Reporting by the United States: For any action affecting the use of a consumptive right whether or not such action is deemed a change in use, the United States agrees to provide the following information to the Department:

a. Well log: For a use that includes the drilling of a well or enlargement of an existing wellbore, the United States agrees to provide a well log to the state within 60 days of the completion of the well.


b. Emergency Use: Within 60 days after the commencement of a temporary emergency use for fire suppression described in Section III.H. of this Compact, the United States agrees to notify the state of the use to which the water was put, the dates of use, and the estimated amount of water used.


c. Annual Report: Between April 1 and May 1 of each year, the United States agrees to provide the Department with a report on (1) actions during the preceding year affecting the use of a consumptive use right described in this Compact, regardless of whether the action is deemed a change in use pursuant to Article II, section J.1.;  (2) the initiation of new uses that were completed during the preceding year;  and (3) any data and documents generated or received by the National Park Service during the preceding year on measurement of instream flow on a Category 3 or 4 stream.



8. Reporting by the State: Between December 1 and December 31 of each year, the Department shall provide the United States with a report of: (1) changes in use during the preceding year, as defined by state law, of water rights upstream of or within the boundaries of reserved land for which a reserved water right is described in this Compact;  (2) new permits issued during the preceding year according to the records of the Department;  and (3) any data and documents generated by the Department during the preceding year on the measurement of streamflows, diversions and well use on or tributary to Category 3 or 4 streams.



K. Administration of Little Bighorn Instream Flow
This section governs the administration of instream flow rights of the United States on the Little Bighorn River described in Article III. section E.3., in relation to junior water rights initiated after the effective date of this Compact to which the United States has not subordinated and which are not a part of the Crow Tribal Water Rights. Nothing in these provisions, or in this Compact, regarding administration affects or in any way impairs any ability or authority of the Crow Tribe to administer, regulate or manage any water rights within the boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation.

1. For purposes of administering the instream flow water right of the United States described in Article III. section E.3. the United States shall establish and maintain a discharge gauge at the LBBNM gauge site. The United States shall keep a record of daily flows for the period from March 1 through June 30 of each year in which the United States seeks curtailment of junior water rights.


2. The United States may seek curtailment to enforce its 950 cfs instream flow water right, described in Article III. section E.3.b., at the LBBNM gauge site any time from May 1 through June 30. The decision to seek curtailment shall be initiated by the NPS and at the NPS's discretion.

a. A decision to seek curtailment to enforce the 950 cfs instream flow water right shall be based on a determination that the flow at the LBBNM gauge site plus claimed or permitted appropriations by non-subordinated junior water users equals 950 cfs or more.


b. Once curtailment is sought and confirmed as set forth in Article II. section K.3, it may last for up to 15 consecutive days, or through June 30, whichever occurs first, provided, however, that the 15 days shall be reduced by subtracting the number of days between March 1st and the date of confirmation of curtailment that the flow at the LBBNM gauge site has equalled or exceeded 950 cfs.


c. Any curtailment based upon the 950 cfs water right shall be limited to direct surface diversions from the Little Bighorn River and its tributaries, and wells completed in the Quaternary Alluvium, Quaternary Terrace Deposits, or the Parkman Sandstone, as described in Article II. section B.2.b.v.(3).



3. Notice by NPS that it seeks curtailment to enforce the 950 cfs instream flow water right shall be by either written or verbal notice to the appropriate DNRC office. The NPS shall use its best efforts to maintain contact with the DNRC beginning May 1st of each year to provide advance warning of stream flow conditions.

a. Upon receipt of notice from the NPS that the United States requests curtailment to enforce the 950 cfs instream flow water right, the DNRC shall, within 24 hours, verify actual diversions by non-subordinated junior water users and confirm that the sum of flow at the LBBNM and actual diversions by non-subordinated junior water users equals or exceeds 950 cfs. If the DNRC determines that the actual diversions are insufficient to bring the flow at the LBBNM gauge site to 950 cfs, it shall not proceed with curtailment. If a decision is made not to proceed with curtailment, the DNRC shall notify the NPS the same day. After notification, the NPS may again seek curtailment beginning the following day if conditions of flow and time of year meet the conditions set forth in Article II. section K.2.


b. If the DNRC proceeds with curtailment to enforce the 950 cfs water right, the DNRC shall, without delay, shut off non-subordinated junior water uses in reverse order of priority to the extent necessary to bring the flow at the LBBNM gauge site to 950 cfs, provided that, DNRC has the discretion to forgo curtailment of a particular water right if it determines that curtailment of that water right to satisfy the 950 cfs instream flow right would be futile.


c. Should flow at the LBBNM gauge site exceed 950 cfs at any time during curtailment, the DNRC may reopen diversions in order of priority until 950 cfs is reached. Should the flow at the LBBNM gauge site drop below 950 cfs at any time during the curtailment, non-subordinated junior water uses shall remain shut off provided that, if the NPS reasonably determines the flow at the LBBNM gauge site is not likely to come back up to 950 cfs during the remainder of the curtailment period, it may consent to end the curtailment.



4. Notice by NPS that it seeks curtailment to enforce the 51 cfs instream flow water right described in Article III. section E.3.a., shall be by either written or verbal notice to the appropriate DNRC office. Upon receipt of notice from the NPS that the United States requests a curtailment to enforce the 51 cfs instream flow water right, the DNRC shall, within 24 hours, verify actual diversions by non-subordinated junior water users. If diversions are being made by non-subordinated junior water users, the DNRC shall, without delay, shut off non-subordinated junior water uses in order of priority to the extent necessary to bring the flow at the LBBNM gauge site to 51 cfs, provided that, DNRC has the discretion to forgo curtailment of a particular water right if it determines that curtailment of that water right to satisfy the 51 cfs instream flow right would be futile.


5. All permits within the Little Bighorn River Basin upstream of the LBBNM gauge site with a priority date after the effective date of this Compact shall be conditioned on the prior right of the NPS for 950 cfs instream flow water right at the LBBNM during May and June, and for the 51 cfs instream flow water right during any portion of the year, and on the authority of DNRC to curtail use to satisfy the instream flow right.


6. All diversions from the Little Bighorn River or its tributaries above LBBNM with a priority date after the effective date of this Compact, shall have the duty to establish and maintain a controllable headgate and an adequate measuring device and shall also be required to maintain a record of daily water diversions, including noting the number of hours for which diversions are made for each day and the flow rate at which water is diverted.


7. DNRC and NPS shall work together to develop a quantitative prediction relationship between the flow at the LBBNM gauge site, diversions by non-subordinated junior water users, and the prediction of curtailment requirements.


8. Either party has the right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction for administration of water rights or for appointment of a water commissioner should cooperative administration not be proceeding as planned or should cooperative administration become burdensome. Any water commissioner shall enforce the curtailment as described in this Compact. Exhaustion of administrative remedies pursuant to this Article is not a prerequisite to any such suit.

4. Hot Springs tributary to Bear Creek and the Yellowstone River
The hot springs that contribute to Bear Creek outside the boundaries of YNP are important to maintenance of biologic values of reserved water in the Yellowstone River downstream from the confluence with Bear Creek. As part of the settlement of the reserved water right for YNP, the state agrees to grant the United States a water right under state law to all of the natural flow of the Bear Creek hot springs located at the mouth of Bear Creek in S1/2 S1/2, sec. 19, T9S, R9E, Montana Principle Meridian. The priority date is the effective date of this Compact.


5. Lakes

The United States has a reserved water right for the maintenance of natural water levels in all naturally occurring lakes within the boundaries of YNP for the purpose of preserving unimpaired these Park resources. The water right for the maintenance of lake levels is subordinate to (1) any United States' consumptive use rights described in this Compact;  and (2) any water right recognized under state law with a priority date before January 1, 1993. The named and unnamed lakes in which the United States has a reserved water right are those set forth more specifically in the Abstract.


H. Emergency Fire Suppression
The use of water for emergency fire suppression benefits the public, and is necessary for the purposes of the various Park reservations. The United States, may as part of its reserved water right, divert water for fire suppression at all of the National Park Service Units as needed, and without a definition of the specific elements of a recordable water right. Use of water for fire suppression shall not be deemed an exercise of the United States' reserved water rights for consumptive use or a violation of its reserved water rights for instream flow.

ARTICLE IV


YELLOWSTONE CONTROLLED GROUNDWATER AREA



A. Statement of Intent
Yellowstone National Park was reserved for the express purpose of “preservation, from injury or spoliation, of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural condition.” 17 Stat. 32. The parties agree that Congress reserved water necessary to preserve the hydrothermal features within the reserved land of YNP. These reserved water rights have priorities as of the date on which the land was reserved.
The parties understand that knowledge of the interrelationship of hydrothermal features within YNP, the hydrothermal system that supports those features, and groundwater in surrounding areas of Montana will benefit from increased study. The parties agree that the hydrothermal features of YNP are a unique and irreplaceable resource and represent one of the few undisturbed hydrothermal systems in the United States.
This Compact does not recognize a reserved water right to groundwater outside the boundaries of the reserved land of YNP. However, the parties agree that restrictions shall be placed on the development of groundwater adjacent to YNP to the extent necessary to prevent adverse effect on the reserved water right to groundwater within YNP. The parties agree that the goal of establishment and administration of the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area shall be to allow no impact to the hydrothermal system within the reserved land of YNP.


B. Findings
Ratification of this Compact by the Montana legislature constitutes a finding that:

1. unrestricted use of groundwater adjacent to Yellowstone National Park is likely to interfere with the water rights reserved by the United States in 1872, 1929, 1930, and 1932, for the preservation of hydrothermal features within YNP;


2. prevention of adverse effect on the United States' reserved water right to groundwater within the reserved land of YNP is a benefit to the state and to the United States;


3. the public interest and welfare requires that a corrective control be adopted to regulate groundwater development adjacent to YNP;  and


4. the cooperative state-federal management and oversight established by this Article is an effective means to achieve protection of the reserved water right to groundwater necessary to preserve the hydrothermal system within the reserved land of YNP.



C. General Provisions

1. Establishment: The Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area or “Area” is hereby established and shall be defined and administered according to this Compact.


2. Funding: The United States agrees that it receives substantial benefit from the establishment and administration of the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area, and that the national and international public benefit extends far beyond the boundaries of the state. Thus, the United States agrees that the relatively small population of the state should not bear the entire cost of protection of the United States' reserved water right. To this end, the Department of the Interior agrees, subject to appropriations by Congress, to reimburse the state for the expense of establishment, administration and enforcement of the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area by the Department;  to fund the inventory, sampling, reporting and database management by the Bureau;  and, except as provided in Article IV, section J.1.c., to fund the administrative costs and the cost of any study or any other necessary activity pursuant to this Article by the Technical Oversight Committee.


3. Implementation Contingent on Funds: Such funding shall be accomplished pursuant to the terms and conditions of a separate agreement which shall incorporate terms and conditions necessary to specify the activities to be funded and appropriate cost and accounting principles consistent with generally applicable guidelines for federal funding in similar circumstances, and consistent with the terms of this Compact, including, but not limited to, the enumeration of state expenses to be reimbursed in Article IV, section C.2. The state is relieved of its obligation to establish, administer, inventory, sample and maintain a database on the Controlled Groundwater Area in the absence of a funding agreement and the provision of the funds specified therein. If the state is relieved of its obligation to implement all or a portion of this Article, all other terms of this Compact shall remain in effect, including all reserved water rights established herein. Such agreement may be amended, extended, renewed or terminated pursuant to its terms.


4. Interim Measures:
The state agrees that the following interim measures shall apply from the effective date of this Compact until the receipt of funds from the United States or December 31, 1995, whichever occurs first. The United States agrees to reimburse the state for the cost of the interim measures, subject to the appropriation of funds by Congress. The parties agree that, even if funding is not received by December 31, 1995 and interim measures are suspended, the state and the Department of the Interior will continue to recommend federal funding.

a. The Department shall issue the notice required by Article IV, section F.


b. All permits issued within this time period within the Area shall be conditioned on appropriation of water of less than 60° F., measured at the wellhead.


c. The Department shall require that each applicant for a permit or person filing a notice of completion for issuance of a certificate of water right to appropriate groundwater within the Area report the following information on filing of a well log: (1) well location to the quarter-quarter-quarter-quarter section;  (2) ground elevation at the wellhead;  (3) well depth;  (4) water level;  (5) flow rate or maximum pump capacity;  and (6) water temperature measured at the wellhead.


d. The Department shall not issue a certificate of water right for the appropriation of groundwater with a temperature of 60° F. or more within the Area during this time period. The Department shall order temporary abandonment of any well in the Area for which a conditional permit was issued or notice of completion for issuance of a certificate of water right was filed within this time period that produces groundwater with a temperature of 60° F. or more, measured at the wellhead. Temporary abandonment shall be according to the rules of the Montana Board of Water Well Contractors.


e. Following receipt of funds from the United States, the Department shall notify the applicant that the appropriation is subject to the terms of this Compact and shall proceed according to the procedures set forth in this Article. If funds are not received by December 31, 1995, the Department may remove the order of temporary abandonment and remove the condition on the permit or issue the certificate of water right pursuant to state law. The Department shall continue to require that each applicant for a permit or certificate of water right to appropriate groundwater within the Area report the following information on filing of a well log: (1) well location to the quarter-quarter-quarter-quarter section;  (2) ground elevation at the wellhead;  (3) well depth;  (4) water level;  (5) flow rate or maximum pump capacity;  and (6) water temperature measured at the wellhead.



5. Additional Studies: In addition to appropriations necessary to implement this Article, the state and the National Park Service agree to recommend federal funding for a baseline study of hydrothermal features in YNP and within the Controlled Groundwater Area, for continued monitoring of these features, and for geologic and geophysical studies including, but not limited to, geologic mapping, and monitoring of microearthquakes and subsidence in and adjacent to YNP. Implementation of this Article is not contingent on such appropriation.


6. Access for Studies: Consistent with the purposes of YNP, the United States agrees to allow reasonable access to and across YNP to the extent necessary to accomplish the data collection authorized by this Article or additional studies recommended pursuant to Article IV, section C.5. In seeking access, the Department or Bureau shall comply with the provisions of Article II, section I.3.


7. Effect of Modification of Area: It is the intent of the parties that the initial boundaries of the Area set forth in Article IV, section D. and Appendix 3, and initial restrictions set forth in Article IV, section E. may be modified pursuant to Article IV, section J., or with respect to a single appropriation pursuant to Article IV, section G.2.c. and shall not be deemed to be a modification of this Compact. Any other modification of this Article shall be considered a modification of this Compact and is subject to the terms of Article VI, section A.2.


8. It is the intention of the Department of the Interior to protect the hydrothermal resources of Yellowstone National Park through the system established by Article IV.

a. The National Park Service agrees, consistent with 
43 U.S.C. § 666
, that enforcement will not be sought against the holder of a water right recognized under state law with a priority date on or after January 1, 1993, unless the NPS has, in the first instance, sought enforcement through the state under the terms of this Compact.


b. Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, if the National Park Service, in its judgment, determines that circumstances warrant, nothing in this Compact prohibits the United States from petitioning a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive or declarative relief. Nothing in this Compact shall alter the courts' application of the test for injunctive relief;  neither shall the administrative determination by the National Park Service to seek relief in said court be deemed to establish or preclude any determination in such judicial proceedings. Prior to such an administrative determination, the National Park Service agrees that it will provide the State written notice and will identify a time frame during which it will await the State's efforts to address the concern.


c. As to an action against the holder of a right to withdraw groundwater recognized under state law with a priority date before January 1, 1993, the United States agrees that this Compact shall not be used or relied upon as evidence to show that: (1) a reserved water right of the United States exists appurtenant to any land other than the reserved land of YNP;  or (2) the priority date associated with any portion of reserved land of YNP is other than the date on which that portion of land was actually reserved.




D. Initial Boundaries of the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area
The initial boundaries of the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area and Subareas are defined to include the area in the State of Montana located within the geographic boundaries shown on Appendix 3. Appendix 3 is hereby incorporated in this Compact by this reference as though set forth here in full.

1. Subarea I:
The initial geographic boundaries of the subarea referred to as Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Subarea I shall include all of the area in Montana North and West of YNP within the boundary delineated as subarea I on Appendix 3.


2. Subarea II:
The initial geographic boundaries of the subarea referred to as Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Subarea II shall include all the area in Montana North and West of YNP within the boundary delineated as subarea II on Appendix 3.



E. Initial Restrictions on Groundwater Development within the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area
Until the initial boundaries or restrictions set forth in this Article are modified pursuant to Article IV, section J., the restrictions set forth in this section shall apply to groundwater appropriations within the Area with a priority date on or after January 1, 1993. Such appropriations shall follow the procedural requirements of Article IV, section G.

1. The parties agree that the initial restrictions on development of groundwater and any modification thereof, shall not apply to appropriations with a priority date before January 1, 1993. The sole provisions of this Article applicable to such appropriations shall be those providing for inventory and sampling of current use set forth in Article IV, section H. Groundwater appropriations with a priority date before January 1, 1993 are subject to applicable state law including, but not limited to, issuance of a certificate of water right following final adjudication of existing water rights. Nothing herein waives the right of the United States to seek protection of its reserved water right for protection of the hydrothermal features within the reserved land of YNP from groundwater appropriations with a priority date before January 1, 1993 in a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction, provided that the limitation on use of this Compact in an action by the United States against any such appropriator set forth in Article IV, section C.8.c. shall apply.


2. The Department shall not issue a permit to appropriate groundwater that is hydrothermal discharge water as defined by this Compact unless either: (1) modification occurs pursuant to Article IV, section J. altering pertinent boundaries or restrictions;  or (2) an application is approved pursuant to Article IV, section G.2.c. Unless modification occurs pursuant to Article IV, section J., the Department shall not limit an appropriation of groundwater that is not hydrothermal discharge water unless required to do so by Article II and III of this Compact or any other provision of state law.



F. General Notice of Establishment of the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area

1. Notice: Within 120 days after the effective date of this Compact and within 60 days of any decision by the Department to modify the Area as set forth in Article IV, section J., the Department shall publish a notice of establishment or modification of the Area setting forth:

a. the description by legal subdivisions of all lands included in the controlled groundwater area;


b. the purpose of the controlled groundwater area or modification;  and


c. the permit requirements, restrictions, inventory, sampling and monitoring applicable within each subarea.



2. Publication and Service: Such notice shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the county or counties in which the Area is located. The Department shall also serve a copy of the notice by mail on each well driller licensed in Montana whose address is within any county in which any part of the Area is located;  on each well driller known by the Department to operate in the Area;  on the Montana State Bureau of Mines and Geology;  on the mayor or chair of the governing body of each county or incorporated municipality located in whole or in part within the Area;  and on the United States. The Department may also serve notice on any other person or state or federal agency that the Department believes may be interested in or affected by the proposed designation or modification of the Area. A copy of the notice shall be mailed to each person's last known address according to the records of the Department.



G. Appropriations of Groundwater within the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area With a Priority Date on or After January 1, 1993

1. Appropriation of Groundwater within the Area with a Priority Date on or after January 1, 1993 and before the Effective Date of this Compact:

The initial restrictions on groundwater development set forth in Article IV, section E. apply to appropriations of groundwater with a priority date on or after January 1, 1993 and before the effective date of this Compact provided that the following procedural requirements are met:

a. Within 120 days after the effective date of this Compact or the receipt of adequate funds from Congress, whichever occurs later, the Department shall provide the United States with notice of all groundwater appropriations within the Area that, according to the records of the Department, have a priority date on or after January 1, 1993 and before the effective date of this Compact.


b. Subsequent to the notice provided for in Article IV, section G.1.a. and up to 120 days following mailing of the report on inventory provided in Article IV, section H.1.b.iii., the United States may provide the Department with credible information on any groundwater appropriation within the Area with a priority date on or after January 1, 1993 and before the effective date of this Compact, showing that the appropriation is of water with a temperature of 60° F. or more.


c. If the United States provides the information set forth in Article IV, section G.1.b., the Department shall, within 60 days of receipt of the information, issue an order requiring that the appropriator comply with the applicable restrictions. The order is effective within 60 days of issuance unless the appropriator enters an appearance to contest the order.


d. If the appropriator enters an appearance to contest the order, the Department shall: (1) issue an order staying use of the appropriation pending final decision on the matter by the Department;  (2) set a date for a hearing;  and (3) proceed pursuant to the provisions for a contested case under the Montana Administrative Procedures Act, Title 2, Chapter 4 of the Montana Code Annotated, provided that in such a proceeding the United States has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the appropriation is of groundwater of 60° F or more. If the United States meets this burden, the appropriator shall comply with procedures and restrictions set forth in Article IV, section G.2.

2. Appropriations of Groundwater with a Priority Date after the Effective Date of this Compact

a. General Provisions

i. All groundwater appropriations within the Area after the effective date of this Compact are subject to this Article.

iii. If, subsequent to the effective date of this Compact, modification pursuant to Article IV, section J. removes the restrictions set forth in Article IV, section E., the monitoring recommended by the Working Group Report or as superseded by the TOC shall continue to apply unless the applicant shows by clear and convincing evidence that such monitoring is inappropriate, according to the criteria in the Working Group Report or as superseded by the TOC.



b. Appropriations of Groundwater with a Temperature of less than 60° F

i. Registration and Application

(1) An applicant for an appropriation of groundwater of 35 gpm or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet per year shall register for a permit by filing a form prescribed by the Department that shall include, but not be limited to, a statement of whether the proposed use requires water with temperature of 60° F. or more, the well location, and intended use and shall comply with the provisions of Article II and III, if applicable. The Department shall provide notice of the registration for a permit to the United States within 30 days of the filing.


(2) An applicant for a permit to appropriate groundwater of greater than 35 gpm or 10 acre-feet per year after the effective date of this Compact, shall comply with existing state law for permits to appropriate water and the limits on groundwater appropriations set forth in Articles II and III, if applicable. The Department may issue an interim permit for the proposed appropriation to an applicant seeking an appropriation for a use that does not require water with a temperature of 60° F. or more if the requirements of this section are met.



ii. Drilling

(1) On filing a proper registration form, an applicant for an appropriation of 35 gpm or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet per year, with a proposed use that does not require water with a temperature of 60° F. or more may complete the proposed well subject to state law and the terms of this Compact, but shall not put the water to beneficial use until issuance of a permit.


(2) Upon issuance of an interim permit, an applicant for an appropriation of greater than 35 gpm or 10 acre-feet per year may drill the well subject to state law and the terms of this Compact, but shall not put the water to beneficial use until issuance of a permit.



iii. Within 60 days of drilling of the well, the applicant or registrant shall provide the Department with a well log on a form provided by the Department. The well log shall include well location to the quarter-quarter-quarter-quarter section;  ground elevation at the wellhead;  well depth;  water level;  flow rate or maximum pump rate;  water temperature measured at the wellhead;  and specific conductance of the water produced using a device provided by the Water Resources Regional Office.


iv. The Department shall forward a copy of the well log to the United States and to the Bureau on receipt.


v. Following receipt of the well log, the Department may inspect the well at a reasonable hour of the day to verify the information on the well log report. The United States may request to accompany the inspector as set forth in Article II, section I.4.


vi. The United States has 60 days from the mailing of the report to file an objection setting forth credible information that the appropriation is of groundwater with characteristics to which restrictions established pursuant to this Article apply.


vii. The Department may issue a permit to appropriate if: (1) the well log and any verification confirm that the appropriation is of water to which no restrictions pursuant to this Article apply;  and (2) all other requirements of state law and this Compact have been met, unless the United States files an objection pursuant to Article IV, section G.2.b.vi. If the well log or verification indicate appropriation of water to which restrictions pursuant to this Article apply or if the United States files a proper objection, the applicant shall be subject to the provisions of Article IV, section G.2.c.


viii. If a permit is issued, the applicant or registrant may complete the appropriation and apply the water to beneficial use.


ix. Within 60 days of completion of the appropriation, the permittee shall file a notice of completion with the Department pursuant to state law.



c. Appropriation of Groundwater with a Temperature of 60° F. or Greater



If an application or registration for a permit within the Area is for a use requiring groundwater with a temperature of 60° F. or more or the well log or any verification indicates water of 60° F. or more, the following provisions apply:

i. Subarea I--groundwater with a temperature of 85° F. or more:

Groundwater of 85° F. or more in Subarea I is presumed to be hydrothermal discharge water. The Department shall not process or grant an application for a permit to appropriate water with a temperature of 85° F. or more in Subarea I, unless the appropriation is consistent with modification of restrictions pursuant to Article IV, section J., or pursuant to the procedures set forth below. An application for an appropriation that proposes to do no more than divert the unenhanced natural surface flow of a spring that is not located in the mainstem of the reserved portion of a stream to which a reserved water right for instream flow is described in Article III of this Compact is not subject to these restrictions.

(1) The application shall set forth credible information that the proposed appropriation does not include contribution by hydrothermal discharge water;


(2) Within 30 days of receipt of the information the Department shall seek review of the application by the TOC.


(3) The TOC shall review the report to determine if the appropriation can take place without adverse effect on the hydrothermal system within YNP. In performing the review, the TOC shall utilize the best available scientific information. The TOC shall resolve doubt in favor of protection of the hydrothermal system within YNP.


(4) Within 60 days of the request by the Department, the TOC shall recommend, in a report to the Department, if, and under what conditions the appropriation could be allowed without adverse effect on the hydrothermal system within YNP. The TOC may recommend limits or conditions on the proposed appropriation that, in the opinion of the TOC, would allow the development while protecting the hydrothermal system within YNP. The TOC shall also provide the Department with a dissenting report pursuant to Article IV, section J.1., if applicable.


(5) On receipt of the report or reports, the Department shall provide a copy to the United States and the applicant and shall schedule a hearing no less than 60 and no more than 90 days from mailing of the report.


(6) The hearing shall proceed as a contested case under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, Title 2, Chapter 4 of the Montana Code Annotated.


(7) The report or reports, data and other written information produced by the TOC shall be admissible in the hearing without further foundation and not subject to the hearsay objection, subject to the rights of any party or claimant to cross-examine the producer or drafter of the written material and to controvert the same by other evidence. The hearing officer may request that members of the TOC appear to provide expert testimony in the case.


(8) The report and recommendations provided by the TOC have a rebuttable presumption of validity for the purposes of Article IV. The dissenting report, if any, may be used as rebuttal evidence.


(9) If the report recommends denial of the application, the applicant may overcome the presumption by proving by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed appropriation does not include hydrothermal discharge water.


(10) If the application is denied, the Department shall order that the well be temporarily abandoned;  or, if multiple water zones are encountered, the zone of excess temperature be closed to production. Abandonment shall be according to the rules of the Montana Board of Water Well Contractors unless alternative procedures are recommended by the TOC. The abandonment order shall not be lifted until a modification order pursuant to Section IV.J. allows the appropriation or until the department determines that the well should be permanently abandoned.


(11) Within 30 days of an order by the Department pursuant to this section, appeal on the record may be made to a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction. For an appeal to state court, venue shall be the First Judicial District in Helena and the review must be conducted according to the procedures for judicial review of a contested case under the Montana Administrative Procedures Act, Title 2, Chapter 4, of the Montana Code Annotated.

ii. Subarea I--groundwater with a temperature of 60° F. or more, but less than 85° F:


Appropriation of groundwater with a temperature of 60° F. or more, but less than 85° F. in subarea I is subject to the following provisions.

(1) The applicant shall provide credible information that the water meets the following criteria:

(a) the proposed appropriation will do no more than divert the unenhanced natural surface flow of a spring that is not located in the mainstem of the reserved portion of a stream to which a reserved water right for instream flow is described in Article III of this Compact, or


(b) the proposed appropriation meets all of the following criteria:

(i) The water temperature is the result of the normal thermal gradient of the earth plus the mean annual air temperature at the site plus 14° F. Unless modified by the TOC, the Department shall use the following equation to estimate the water temperature expected:

(0.01646 x the depth of the production zone in feet) + 59.3° F.
If the temperature measured at the wellhead is equal to or less than the temperature estimated by this equation, the appropriation meets this criteria.

(ii) the concentration of soluble chloride is less than ten parts per million;  and


(iii) the well does not contain a production zone completed within the Madison Group of formations as defined by the Catalog of Stratigraphic Names for Montana, Bureau of Mines and Geology, Special Publication 54, March 1971.




(2) The Department may issue a permit to appropriate groundwater with a temperature of 60° F or more, but less than 85° F. to an applicant that meets the above criteria and is in compliance with the provisions of Article IV, section G.2.c. unless (a) restrictions are consistent with modification pursuant to Article IV, section J.;  or (b) the United States objects and shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the criteria have not been met or, for another scientific reason, the temperature is the result of contribution by hydrothermal discharge water.


(3) If the applicant fails to meet the above criteria or the United States meets its burden, the applicant shall comply with the provisions of Article IV, section G.2.c.i. for water or 85° F or more.


(4) The three criteria set forth in Article IV, section G.2.c.ii.(1)(b) may be modified on recommendation by the TOC.

iii. Subarea II:

(1) Groundwater of 85° F. or more in subarea II is presumed to be hydrothermal discharge water. The applicant shall follow the procedures of Article IV, section G.2.c.i. including review by the TOC, provided that, if a permit to appropriate is issued the monitoring recommended in the Working Group Report or as superseded by the TOC for subarea II, not subarea I, shall apply.


(2) An applicant who encounters groundwater of 60° F. or more but less than 85° F. shall comply with the provisions of Article IV, section G.2.c.ii., provided that, if a permit to appropriate is issued the monitoring recommended in the Working Group Report or as superseded by the TOC for subarea II, not subarea I, shall apply.

3. Change in Character of Groundwater: Within 60 days of the receipt of information indicating a change in the character of the groundwater appropriated under a permit issued in the Area on or after January 1, 1993 that indicates the production of groundwater for which a restriction applies, the Department shall issue an order requiring that the appropriator comply with the limitations on appropriation of hydrothermal groundwater authorized in this Article. The order shall take affect 60 days following the date issued unless the appropriator appears to contest the order. If the appropriator appears to contest the order, the Department shall set a date for a hearing and proceed pursuant to the provisions for a contested case under the Montana Administrative Procedures Act, title 2, Chapter 4, of the Montana Code Annotated, provided that the appropriator shall have the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the water produced does not meet the criteria to which restrictions apply.




H. Inventory and Sampling of Groundwater

1. Initial Inventory

5. Within 2 years after the effective date of this Compact or the receipt of the requested funding from the United States, whichever occurs later, the Department is directed to promulgate such additional rules necessary to effectuate this Compact and to establish criteria which may be necessary to implement this Article. Said rules shall not alter the rights or obligations of the parties hereto. In doing so, the Department shall consult with the United States and the TOC. Until modified by the TOC, the Department shall adopt the Working Group Report to govern sampling, reporting and monitoring requirements, except as modified by Article IV, section G. In reviewing any permit to appropriate hydrothermal discharge water the Department shall consider the criteria set forth in the Working Group Report or a subsequent report by the TOC, including, but not limited to, the identification of risk associated with volume of appropriation and distance from the reserved land of YNP.



J. Modification of the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area

1. Technical Oversight Committee: Establishment and Authority

a. A joint federal-state Technical Oversight Committee is hereby established to review scientific evidence related to the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area;  to advise the Department on administration of the Area, including review of applications to appropriate water of 60° F. or more;  to consult with the Bureau on inventory and sampling;  and to recommend modification of boundaries and restrictions.


b. The committee shall consist of five qualified scientists with experience related to hydrothermal systems. The committee members shall be appointed within six months following the effective date of this Compact: one appointed by the National Park Service;  one appointed by the United States Geological Survey;  one appointed by the Department;  one appointed from the Montana University system by the Montana State Geologist;  and one selected by the other four members. Appointments and selections shall be made, to the extent possible, to ensure that three of the qualified scientists with experience related to hydrothermal systems also have experience in (1) geochemistry;  (2) geophysics;  and (3) hydrogeology. Vacancies due to expiration of terms or resignation of a member shall be filled in the same manner. Should the four members fail to agree on the selection of additional members within 60 days after appointment of all four members or within 30 days after a vacancy occurs, the following procedure shall be utilized:

(i) Within 5 days each member shall nominate one person for each vacancy and submit the nominations to a judge of the First Judicial District in Helena;  and


(ii) A judge of the First Judicial District in Helena shall fill the vacancy by selecting a member from each set of nominations.



c. Each member shall serve a five-year term and shall be eligible for reappointment. Expenses of the members shall be born by the entity appointing the member. The per diem or salary, and travel expenses of the three members-at-large shall be born equally by the United States and the state, subject to the availability of funds. All other expenses of the TOC shall be born by the United States subject to Congressional appropriation as set forth in Article IV, section C.


d. The recommendation of any of the following by the TOC shall be based on a supermajority of four to one: (1) modification of the Area pursuant to Article IV, section J;  (2) review of an application to appropriate groundwater with a temperature of 60° F. or more;  and (3) removal of any of the criteria specified in Article IV, section G.[2.]c.ii.(1)(b). Failure to achieve a supermajority shall result in a recommendation of no modification or no permit approval. In the absence of a unanimous decision, the TOC shall provide both a report supporting the recommendation that there be no modification or no permit approval, and a dissenting report to the Department. In all other instances in which the TOC consults with or makes recommendations to the Department or the Bureau, recommendations shall be made by a simple majority of the entire committee.


e. The TOC shall:

i. review the boundaries of the Area and the Subareas;


ii. review the initial restrictions on groundwater development imposed pursuant to this Article, and future modifications of those restrictions;


iii. assess the cumulative impact of all development in the Area;


iv. review changes in the groundwater and hydrothermal systems revealed by inventory and analyses done by the Bureau, and any other pertinent scientific evidence;


v. review new scientific evidence pertinent to the Area;


vi. consult with the Bureau or the Department on request;


vii. present evidence and make recommendations to the Department in accordance with Article IV, section J.2.


viii. review applications for a permit to appropriate groundwater on request by the Department as set forth in Article IV, section G.2.c.;  and


ix. take any additional action necessary to implement this Article.



f. The Department and the Bureau shall provide the TOC with all information in their records regarding appropriations of groundwater within the Area including reports required by this Article.


g. The initial review shall take place within 1 year of the receipt of the inventory report done by the Bureau pursuant to Article IV, section H. Subsequent reviews shall take place every 5 years following the initial inventory or following the issuance of 75 permits to appropriate water within the Area by the Department, whichever occurs first. Additional review shall also take place on request by the United States or the state.


h. Within 6 months of initiation of a review, the TOC shall provide a report of the review, including any recommendation for modification, and a dissenting report, if any, to the Department and the United States. Recommendations shall be based on a determination by a supermajority of the entire TOC that the modification is necessary to prevent adverse effect to the hydrothermal system within the reserved land of YNP, or that modification may be made without the threat of adverse effect on the hydrothermal system within the reserved land of YNP. The recommendation shall be made in good faith and based on scientific evidence including, but not limited to, the following:

i. in the case of extension of boundaries, the criteria set out in the Working Group Report for designation of the boundary of the Area to be enlarged is found to exist within the proposed extension;


ii. the cumulative effect of groundwater development within the Area or a portion of the Area has resulted in declining hydraulic head and modification of boundaries or restrictions are necessary to prevent adverse effect on the hydrothermal system within the reserved land of YNP;


iii. changes in groundwater revealed by the inventory and sampling program are such that modification is necessary to prevent adverse effect on the hydrothermal system within the reserved land of YNP;


iv. scientific evidence indicates that modification is necessary to prevent adverse effect on the hydrothermal system within the reserved land of YNP;


v. based on scientific evidence, restrictions can be removed or boundary modifications made without the threat of adverse effect to the hydrothermal system within the reserved land of YNP.

ARTICLE V


GENERAL PROVISIONS



A. No Effect on Tribal Rights or Other Federal Reserved Water Rights:

1. Nothing in this Compact may be construed or interpreted in any manner to establish the nature, extent or manner of administration of the rights to water [with respect to BHNB, GNP, and YNP or] the nature or extent of the rights to water or the right to administer water [with respect to BCNRA and LBBNM] of an Indian Tribe in Montana, or of a water right of an individual that is derivative of such right, or of the United States on behalf of such tribe or tribal member. The relationship between the water rights of the National Park Service described herein and any rights to water of an Indian Tribe in Montana, or of a water right of an individual that is derivative of such right, or of the United States on behalf of such tribe or tribal member shall be determined by the rule of priority. The United States specifically recognizes the seniority of the Crow Tribal Water Rights.


2. Nothing in this Compact is otherwise intended to conflict with or abrogate a right or claim of an Indian Tribe regarding boundaries or property interests in the State of Montana.


3. Nothing in this Compact may be construed or interpreted in any manner to establish the nature, extent or manner of administration of the rights to water of any other federal agency or federal lands in Montana other than those of the National Park Service. The exercise of a water right of the United States, if any, to water for a consumptive use on land administered by the United States Forest Service upstream of a water right to instream flow described in this Compact shall be allocated from the United States' share for instream flow, not the state's share for consumptive use.



B. State Water Rights
Nothing in this Compact may limit the exclusive authority of the state, including the authority of a water commissioner authorized by state law, to administer all current and future water rights recognized under state law within and upstream of the reserved land covered by this Compact, provided that in administration of those water rights in which the United States has an interest, such authority is limited to that granted under federal law.


C. General Disclaimers
Nothing in this Compact may be construed or interpreted:

1. as a precedent for the litigation or the interpretation or administration of future compacts between the United States and the state;  or of the United States and any other state;


2. as a waiver by the United States of its right under state law to raise objections in state court to individual water rights claimed pursuant to the state Water Use Act, Title 85, of the Montana Code Annotated, in the basins affected by this Compact;


3. as a waiver by the United States of its right to seek relief from a conflicting water use not entitled to protection under the terms of this Compact;


4. to establish a precedent for other agreements between the state and the United States or an Indian tribe;


5. to determine the relative rights, inter sese, of persons using water under the authority of state law or to limit the rights of the parties or a person to litigate an issue not resolved by this Compact;


6. to create or deny substantive rights through headings or captions used in this Compact;


7. to expand or restrict any waiver of sovereign immunity existing pursuant to federal law as of the effective date of this Compact;


8. to affect the right of the state to seek fees or reimbursement for costs or the right of the United States to contest the imposition of such fees or costs, pursuant to a ruling by a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction or Act of Congress;


9. to affect in any manner the entitlement to or quantification of other federal water rights. This Compact is only binding on the United States with regard to the water rights of the National Park Service, and does not affect the water rights of any other federal agency.


10. to alter or amend any provisions of the Yellowstone River Compact, Act of October 30, 1951, ch. 629, 65 Stat. 663 (1951).



D. Use of Water Right
Except as otherwise provided in this Compact, the rights of the United States described in this agreement are federal reserved water rights. Non-use of all or a part of the federal reserved water rights described in this Compact shall not constitute abandonment of the right. The federal reserved water rights described in this Compact need not be applied to a use deemed beneficial under state law, but shall be restricted to uses necessary to fulfill the purposes of the associated reserved land.


E. Appropriation Pursuant to State Law
Nothing in this Compact may prevent the United States from seeking a permit to appropriate water under state law for use outside the boundaries of the federal reservations for which a water right is described in this Compact, provided that, no such use may be included in the calculation of total current or future consumptive use rights allocated to use pursuant to state law by this Compact, and provided further that, a water right obtained in this manner shall be considered a state water right and shall be administered pursuant to general provisions of state law as provided in Article II, section J.2.b.


F. Reservation of Rights
The parties expressly reserve all rights not granted, described or relinquished in this Compact.


G. Severability
Except as provided in Article IV, the provisions of this Compact are not severable, provided that for the purposes of 
Sec. 85-2-702(3) MCA
, the water rights described in this Compact for the LBBNM and BCNRA Units shall be considered as separate Compacts.


H. Multiple Originals
This Compact is executed in quintuplicate. Each of the five (5) Compacts bearing original signatures shall be deemed an original.


I. Notice
Unless otherwise specifically provided for in this Compact, service of notice required hereunder, except service in litigation, shall be:

1. State: Upon the Director of the Department and such other officials as he or she may designate in writing.


2. United States: Upon the Secretary of the Interior and such other officials as he or she may designate in writing.


ARTICLE VI

D. The parties agree to seek enactment of legislation and to recommend appropriation of federal funds necessary to effectuate the provisions and purposes of this Compact, and to defend the provisions and purposes of this Compact from all challenges and attacks.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF the representatives of the State of Montana and the United States have signed this Compact on the 30th day of May, 1995.

FOR THE STATE OF MONTANA


MONTANA RESERVED WATER RIGHTS COMPACT COMMISSION


FOR THE UNITED STATES




A. Abstract:
Concurrent with this Compact, the parties have prepared an Abstract, a copy of which is referenced as Appendix 1, which is a specific listing of all of the United States' water rights [for Big Hole National Battlefield, Glacier National Park, and Yellowstone National Park, and] prepared an Abstract, a copy of which is referenced as Appendix 2, which is a specific listing of all of the United States' water rights for Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area and the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument that are described in this Compact and quantified in accordance with this Compact. The parties prepared the Abstract to comply with the requirements for a final decree as set forth in 
85-2-234(4)
 and 
(7), MCA
, and in an effort to assist the state courts in the process of entering decrees accurately and comprehensively reflecting the rights described in this Compact. The rights specified in the Abstract are subject to the terms of this Compact. In the event of a discrepancy between a right listed in the Abstract and that same right as quantified in accordance with Articles II and III of this Compact, the parties intend that the quantification in accordance with Articles II and III of this Compact shall be reflected in a final decree.


B. Method of Allocation of Water on Category 3 and 4 Streams and of Determining Rights Subject to Curtailment on the Little Bighorn River and its Tributaries:
This section explains the method of quantification of the reserved instream flow water rights of the United States for Category 3 and 4 streams and the method of calculating the quantity of consumptive use pursuant to state law within a basin to which the United States agrees to subordinate its reserved instream flow water right. The method set forth in this section shall be used to determine whether the limits on consumptive use pursuant to state law set forth in Article III have been reached and whether a water right on the Little Bighorn River and its tributaries upstream from the LBBNM shall be subject to curtailment to satisfy the reserved instream flow water right for LBBNM. Addition to the Abstract of a reserved instream flow water right on a stream inadvertently omitted by the parties or reclassification of a stream due to a water right recognized under state law and inadvertently omitted by the parties shall be consistent with this section and shall not be deemed a modification of this Compact.

1. Allocation to Instream Flow:

With the exception of the reserved instream flow rights for LBBNM, the allocation of water to instream flow on Category 3 and 4 streams is arrived at using the following method as explained in general terms:

a. The United States' reserved water right for instream flow includes the entire flow of that stream within the State of Montana at the point where the stream flows over or forms the boundary of the specified reserved land after: (1) all consumptive use water rights of any agency of the United States recognized under federal or state law are satisfied;  and (2) subordination of the reserved water right for instream flow to water rights recognized under state law as set forth in and limited by Article III and more specifically in the Abstract.


b. Actual use of water in Wyoming or Canada shall not diminish the quantity of water designated for consumptive use pursuant to state law as set forth in Article III.

2. Method of Calculation of Consumptive Use Rights Recognized Under State Law:


To determine whether water is available for appropriation for consumptive use pursuant to state law on Category 3 and 4 streams, and for determining whether the limit on subordination of the United States' water rights to consumptive uses has been reached, the following provisions shall apply:

a. Tributary Water: The calculation of total consumptive use on a Category 3 or 4 stream shall include all current and future consumptive use, recognized under state law, of surface water tributary to the stream to the point it enters the reserved land. The limits on total consumptive use on a Category 4 stream that forms the boundary of the reserved land shall include all current and future consumptive use recognized under state law, of surface water tributary to the stream to the most downstream point that the stream forms the boundary of the reserved land.


b. Groundwater: [The following sections i., ii., and iii. shall apply to BHNB, GNP, and YNP.] The following sections iii. and iv. shall apply to BCNRA. The following sections iii. and v. shall apply to LBBNM.

i. An exemption from state permit requirements for wells or developed springs shall not apply to appropriations within a basin tributary to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream after the effective date of this Compact, provided that the registration process set forth in Article II, section B.2.b.ii.(3)(b) shall apply to applications for a permit for a well of 35 gpm or less, not to exceed 10 acre-feet per year. In addition, all groundwater appropriations within the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area shall be subject to Article IV.


ii. The calculation of total consumptive use on a Category 3 or 4 stream shall include appropriations of groundwater as follows:

(1) Pre-January 1, 1993: An appropriation of groundwater with a priority date before January 1, 1993, shall not be included in the calculation of total consumptive use.


(2) January 1, 1993--Effective Date: An appropriation of groundwater with a priority date on or after January 1, 1993, but before the effective date of this Compact shall be included in the calculation of total consumptive use if the following procedural requirements are met and the appropriation is found to be hydrologically connected to surface water tributary to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream.

(a) Within 120 days after the effective date of this Compact, the Department shall provide the United States with notice of all groundwater appropriations in drainages tributary to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream that, according to the records of the Department, have a priority date on or after January 1, 1993 and before the effective date of this Compact.


(b) Up to 120 days following mailing of such notice the United States shall provide the Department with credible information that a groundwater appropriation included in the notice is hydrologically connected to surface flow tributary to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream.


(c) Within 60 days of receipt of such information, the Department shall issue an order stating that (1) the appropriation is hydrologically connected to surface water tributary to the Category 3 or 4 stream;  and (2) the action to be taken with respect to the appropriation. The order is effective within 60 days of issuance unless the appropriator enters an appearance to contest the order. If credible information of hydrologic connection has not been provided by the United States, the Department shall issue an order stating its determination and reasons therefore.


(d) If the appropriator enters an appearance to contest the order, the Department shall (1) issue an order staying use of the appropriation pending a final decision on the matter by the Department only if the limits on total consumptive use for that drainage have been reached;  (2) set a date for a hearing;  and (3) proceed pursuant to the provisions for a contested case under the Montana Administrative Procedures Act, Title 2, Chapter 4, of the Montana Code Annotated, provided that the burden of proving hydrologic connection shall be as set forth in Article II, section B.2.b.[ii.](3). The Department shall, whenever possible, consolidate any proceedings on the groundwater application pursuant to Article IV with any proceeding made necessary by this Article.



(3) Post-Effective Date: An appropriation of groundwater recognized under state law with a priority date after the effective date of this Compact shall be included in the calculation of total consumptive use if the following conditions apply:

(a) Wells in excess of 35 gallons per minute or 10 acre-feet per year: The limit on total consumptive use shall include groundwater appropriation by a well or developed spring with a permit amount in excess of 35 gpm or any well with a volume of use greater than 10 acre-feet per year, including a combined appropriation from the same source from two or more wells or developed springs that exceeds these limitations, unless the applicant is able to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the appropriation is not hydrologically connected to surface flow tributary to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream.

(i) The applicant shall submit credible information, including a report to the Department prepared by a professional qualified in the science of groundwater hydrology verifying that the appropriation is not hydrologically connected to surface flow tributary to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream. If the applicant fails to submit the report, the application shall be considered defective and shall be returned to the applicant for completion as provided by state law.


(ii) The Department shall provide notice of the proposed appropriation and a copy of the report to the United States concurrent with notice pursuant [to] 
85-2-307, MCA
.


(iii) Within 60 days of the mailing of notice, the United States shall file an objection to the proposed appropriation on the basis that it is hydrologically connected to surface water.


(iv) The Department shall not exclude the appropriation from the limits on total consumptive use unless the applicant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed appropriation is not hydrologically connected to surface flows tributary to the reserved portion of the Category 3 or 4 stream. In doing so the Department shall make a specific finding on the adequacy of the report provided by the applicant.


(v) If the proposed appropriation is determined not to be hydrologically connected to surface water, or if the limit on consumptive use has not been reached, the Department may issue a permit in accordance with state law and the applicant may complete the appropriation.



(b) Wells of 35 gallons per minute or less and 10 acre-feet per year or less:

(ii) The Department shall provide notice of the registration for a permit to the United States within 30 days of the filing. Within 30 days of the receipt of notice, the United States may file an objection to the application on the basis that the proposed appropriation is of groundwater that is hydrologically connected to surface flow tributary to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream.


(iii) As long as the limit on consumptive use rights for a Category 3 or 4 stream has not been reached, the calculation of total consumptive use shall not include groundwater appropriations by well or a developed spring of 35 gallons per minute or less that do not exceed 10 acre feet per year unless the United States shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed appropriation is hydrologically connected to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream. If the United States meets this burden, the Department shall include the appropriation in the calculation of total consumptive use.


(iv) After the limit on consumptive use rights has been reached on a particular stream, the necessary showing by the United States' shall be to file an objection and come forward with credible information showing that the proposed appropriation is hydrologically connected to surface flows tributary to the reserved portion of the Category 3 or 4 stream. If the United States makes such a showing, the Department shall consider the application under the criteria in Article II, section B.2.b.[ii.](3)(b)(v) and (vi).

(vi) If the proposed appropriation is determined not to be hydrologically connected to surface water the Department may issue a permit in accordance with state law and the applicant may complete the appropriation.





iii. Within 2 years after the effective date of this Compact, the Department, in consultation with the United States, is directed to promulgate rules as may be necessary to implement Article II, section B.2.b. Said rules shall not alter the rights or obligations of the parties hereto.


iv. The calculation of total future consumptive use on Category 3 or 4 streams at BCNRA shall include appropriations of groundwater as follows:

(1) The calculation of total future consumptive use shall not include appropriation of groundwater by means of a well or developed spring with an appropriation of 35 gallons per minute (gpm) or less that does not exceed 10 acre feet per year (afy).


(2) The limit on total consumptive use shall not include an appropriation of groundwater by means of a well or developed spring with a permit amount in excess of 35 gpm or with a volume of use greater than 10 afy, including a combined appropriation from the same source from two or more wells or developed springs that exceeds these limitations, unless the United States shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the proposed appropriation is hydrologically connected to surface water tributary to the reserved portion of a Category 3 or 4 stream. If the United States meets this burden, the Department shall include the appropriation in the calculation of total consumptive use.

(a) The Department shall provide notice of the proposed appropriation to the United States concurrent with notice pursuant to 
85-2-307, MCA
.


(b) Within 60 days of the mailing of notice, the United States may file an objection to the proposed appropriation on the basis that it is hydrologically connected to surface water.


(c) If the proposed appropriation is determined not to be hydrologically connected to surface water, or if the limit on consumptive use has not been reached, the Department may issue a permit in accordance with state law and the applicant may complete the appropriation.




v. Determination of whether an appropriation of groundwater after the effective date of the this Compact shall be subject to a curtailment to satisfy the instream flow water right at LBBNM shall be made as follows:

(1) Groundwater appropriations subject to curtailment shall not include an appropriation of groundwater for stock or domestic purposes by means of a well or developed spring with an appropriation of 35 gpm or less that does not exceed 10 afy.

85-2-307, MCA
.


(b) Within 60 days of the mailing of notice, the United States may file an objection to the proposed appropriation on the basis that it is hydrologically connected to surface water and the proposed appropriation is to be completed in the Quaternary Alluvium, Quaternary Terrace Deposits, or the Parkman Sandstone.


(c) If the proposed appropriation is determined not to be hydrologically connected to surface water or not to be completed in the Quaternary Alluvium, Quaternary Terrace Deposits, or the Parkman Sandstone the Department may issue a permit in accordance with state law and the applicant may complete the appropriation.


(d) If the proposed appropriation is determined to be hydrologically connected to surface water and to be completed in the Quaternary Alluvium, Quaternary Terrace Deposits, or the Parkman Sandstone the Department may issue the permit in accordance with state law with notice that the appropriation is subject to curtailment to satisfy the instream flow water right of the LBBNM and the applicant may complete the appropriation.





c. Effect of Decree in Calculation of Consumptive Use: Except as provided in Article II, section G., for the purposes of this Compact, the flow rate of a consumptive use shall be as finally decreed in a general adjudication, or recognized under state law until such final decree. At each stage in an adjudication, the allocation to current use as set forth in Article III and more specifically in the Abstract shall be adjusted to reflect the decreed amount.


d. Abandonment: When a consumptive use right recognized under state law on a Category 3 or 4 stream is abandoned and such abandonment causes water to become available for appropriation within the limits of the total amounts of water allocated to consumptive use rights recognized under state law established for that stream by Article III, the increment of water below that limit is available for new appropriation in accordance with state law and this Compact. State law governs the issue of whether an abandonment has occurred.


e. Non-Consumptive Use: The limit on total consumptive use rights recognized under state law shall not include non-consumptive uses as defined by this Compact.



1. Allocation to Instream Flow:


a. The United States' reserved water right for instream flow includes the entire flow of that stream within the State of Montana at the point where the stream flows over or forms the boundary of the specified reserved land after: (1) all consumptive use water rights of any agency of the United States recognized under federal or state law are satisfied;  and (2) subordination of the reserved water right for instream flow to water rights recognized under state law as set forth in and limited by Article III and more specifically in the Abstract.


b. Actual use of water in Wyoming or Canada shall not diminish the quantity of water designated for consumptive use pursuant to state law as set forth in Article III.

Curtailment of uses to which the reserved water rights described in this Compact have not been subordinated during periods of low flow shall proceed on the basis of priority and may be initiated in a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to Article II, sections I and K.


2. The reserved water rights described in this Compact shall not be subordinate to water rights which were forfeited by 
85-2-212
 [or] 85-2-226 as interpreted in 
In the Matter of the Adjudication of the Water Rights within the Yellowstone River, 253 Mont. 167, 832 P.2d 1210 (1992)
, nor shall any claimant of such forfeited water right have standing, based solely on such claimed right, to object to this Compact or any reserved water right described in this Compact, provided that water allocated to future consumptive use pursuant to Article III[B.] of this Compact may be used to satisfy claims filed pursuant to 
85-2-221(3), MCA
 in order of priority.

This prohibition shall include impoundments that are exempt from permit requirements under state law. Reclamation, repair or rehabilitation of an existing impoundment shall not be considered a new impoundment, provided that without the consent of the United States, reclamation, repair or rehabilitation shall not cause the impoundment to exceed the original constructed capacity of the impoundment. This prohibition shall not apply to impoundments constructed to store a Tribal water right or to implement settlement of litigation regarding quantification of a Tribal water right. On Category 3 and 4 streams for which an instream flow right is described for periods of low flow as set forth in Article III, sections G.3.c. and d., such water right has not been subordinated to a new water right with the method of diversion as an impoundment on the mainstem of the stream with a priority date on or after January 1, 1993, but before the effective date of this Compact.


G. Management to Maximize Use by Montana Water Users of the Water Allocated to Consumptive Use Rights Recognized Under State Law: If any type of conservation or water distribution plan which includes measurement of actual water use, including use pursuant to rights recognized under state law with a priority date before January 1, 1993, [with respect to BHNB, GNP, and YNP and] before the effective date of this compact [with respect to BCNRA and LBBNM], is adopted pursuant to state law, the limits established for consumptive use appropriated pursuant to state law shall apply to actual measured use, not permitted and decreed or claimed rights, provided that records of actual use be made available to the United States on request and provided further that, such plan shall not diminish the reserved water right of the United States as described in this Compact.


H. Basin Closure

1. Except as provided in Article II, section B.2.d., in the following drainage basins upstream of the portion of the stream for which a reserved water right for instream flow is described in this Compact, the Department shall not process or grant an application or registration for a permit to appropriate or to reserve water for future consumptive use as defined by this Compact once the limits on consumptive use tabulated in Article III and set forth more specifically in the Abstract are reached:

K. Administration of Little Bighorn Instream Flow
This section governs the administration of instream flow rights of the United States on the Little Bighorn River described in Article III. section E.3., in relation to junior water rights initiated after the effective date of this Compact to which the United States has not subordinated and which are not a part of the Crow Tribal Water Rights. Nothing in these provisions, or in this Compact, regarding administration affects or in any way impairs any ability or authority of the Crow Tribe to administer, regulate or manage any water rights within the boundaries of the Crow Indian Reservation.

1. For purposes of administering the instream flow water right of the United States described in Article III. section E.3. the United States shall establish and maintain a discharge gauge at the LBBNM gauge site. The United States shall keep a record of daily flows for the period from March 1 through June 30 of each year in which the United States seeks curtailment of junior water rights.


2. The United States may seek curtailment to enforce its 950 cfs instream flow water right, described in Article III. section E.3.b., at the LBBNM gauge site any time from May 1 through June 30. The decision to seek curtailment shall be initiated by the NPS and at the NPS's discretion.

a. A decision to seek curtailment to enforce the 950 cfs instream flow water right shall be based on a determination that the flow at the LBBNM gauge site plus claimed or permitted appropriations by non-subordinated junior water users equals 950 cfs or more.


b. Once curtailment is sought and confirmed as set forth in Article II. section K.3, it may last for up to 15 consecutive days, or through June 30, whichever occurs first, provided, however, that the 15 days shall be reduced by subtracting the number of days between March 1st and the date of confirmation of curtailment that the flow at the LBBNM gauge site has equalled or exceeded 950 cfs.


c. Any curtailment based upon the 950 cfs water right shall be limited to direct surface diversions from the Little Bighorn River and its tributaries, and wells completed in the Quaternary Alluvium, Quaternary Terrace Deposits, or the Parkman Sandstone, as described in Article II. section B.2.b.v.(3).



3. Notice by NPS that it seeks curtailment to enforce the 950 cfs instream flow water right shall be by either written or verbal notice to the appropriate DNRC office. The NPS shall use its best efforts to maintain contact with the DNRC beginning May 1st of each year to provide advance warning of stream flow conditions.

a. Upon receipt of notice from the NPS that the United States requests curtailment to enforce the 950 cfs instream flow water right, the DNRC shall, within 24 hours, verify actual diversions by non-subordinated junior water users and confirm that the sum of flow at the LBBNM and actual diversions by non-subordinated junior water users equals or exceeds 950 cfs. If the DNRC determines that the actual diversions are insufficient to bring the flow at the LBBNM gauge site to 950 cfs, it shall not proceed with curtailment. If a decision is made not to proceed with curtailment, the DNRC shall notify the NPS the same day. After notification, the NPS may again seek curtailment beginning the following day if conditions of flow and time of year meet the conditions set forth in Article II. section K.2.


b. If the DNRC proceeds with curtailment to enforce the 950 cfs water right, the DNRC shall, without delay, shut off non-subordinated junior water uses in reverse order of priority to the extent necessary to bring the flow at the LBBNM gauge site to 950 cfs, provided that, DNRC has the discretion to forgo curtailment of a particular water right if it determines that curtailment of that water right to satisfy the 950 cfs instream flow right would be futile.


c. Should flow at the LBBNM gauge site exceed 950 cfs at any time during curtailment, the DNRC may reopen diversions in order of priority until 950 cfs is reached. Should the flow at the LBBNM gauge site drop below 950 cfs at any time during the curtailment, non-subordinated junior water uses shall remain shut off provided that, if the NPS reasonably determines the flow at the LBBNM gauge site is not likely to come back up to 950 cfs during the remainder of the curtailment period, it may consent to end the curtailment.



4. Notice by NPS that it seeks curtailment to enforce the 51 cfs instream flow water right described in Article III. section E.3.a., shall be by either written or verbal notice to the appropriate DNRC office. Upon receipt of notice from the NPS that the United States requests a curtailment to enforce the 51 cfs instream flow water right, the DNRC shall, within 24 hours, verify actual diversions by non-subordinated junior water users. If diversions are being made by non-subordinated junior water users, the DNRC shall, without delay, shut off non-subordinated junior water uses in order of priority to the extent necessary to bring the flow at the LBBNM gauge site to 51 cfs, provided that, DNRC has the discretion to forgo curtailment of a particular water right if it determines that curtailment of that water right to satisfy the 51 cfs instream flow right would be futile.


5. All permits within the Little Bighorn River Basin upstream of the LBBNM gauge site with a priority date after the effective date of this Compact shall be conditioned on the prior right of the NPS for 950 cfs instream flow water right at the LBBNM during May and June, and for the 51 cfs instream flow water right during any portion of the year, and on the authority of DNRC to curtail use to satisfy the instream flow right.


6. All diversions from the Little Bighorn River or its tributaries above LBBNM with a priority date after the effective date of this Compact, shall have the duty to establish and maintain a controllable headgate and an adequate measuring device and shall also be required to maintain a record of daily water diversions, including noting the number of hours for which diversions are made for each day and the flow rate at which water is diverted.


7. DNRC and NPS shall work together to develop a quantitative prediction relationship between the flow at the LBBNM gauge site, diversions by non-subordinated junior water users, and the prediction of curtailment requirements.


8. Either party has the right to petition a court of competent jurisdiction for administration of water rights or for appointment of a water commissioner should cooperative administration not be proceeding as planned or should cooperative administration become burdensome. Any water commissioner shall enforce the curtailment as described in this Compact. Exhaustion of administrative remedies pursuant to this Article is not a prerequisite to any such suit.

ARTICLE IV


YELLOWSTONE CONTROLLED GROUNDWATER AREA



A. Statement of Intent
Yellowstone National Park was reserved for the express purpose of “preservation, from injury or spoliation, of all timber, mineral deposits, natural curiosities, or wonders within said park, and their retention in their natural condition.” 17 Stat. 32. The parties agree that Congress reserved water necessary to preserve the hydrothermal features within the reserved land of YNP. These reserved water rights have priorities as of the date on which the land was reserved.
The parties understand that knowledge of the interrelationship of hydrothermal features within YNP, the hydrothermal system that supports those features, and groundwater in surrounding areas of Montana will benefit from increased study. The parties agree that the hydrothermal features of YNP are a unique and irreplaceable resource and represent one of the few undisturbed hydrothermal systems in the United States.
This Compact does not recognize a reserved water right to groundwater outside the boundaries of the reserved land of YNP. However, the parties agree that restrictions shall be placed on the development of groundwater adjacent to YNP to the extent necessary to prevent adverse effect on the reserved water right to groundwater within YNP. The parties agree that the goal of establishment and administration of the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area shall be to allow no impact to the hydrothermal system within the reserved land of YNP.


B. Findings
Ratification of this Compact by the Montana legislature constitutes a finding that:

1. unrestricted use of groundwater adjacent to Yellowstone National Park is likely to interfere with the water rights reserved by the United States in 1872, 1929, 1930, and 1932, for the preservation of hydrothermal features within YNP;


2. prevention of adverse effect on the United States' reserved water right to groundwater within the reserved land of YNP is a benefit to the state and to the United States;


3. the public interest and welfare requires that a corrective control be adopted to regulate groundwater development adjacent to YNP;  and


4. the cooperative state-federal management and oversight established by this Article is an effective means to achieve protection of the reserved water right to groundwater necessary to preserve the hydrothermal system within the reserved land of YNP.

C. General Provisions

1. Establishment: The Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area or “Area” is hereby established and shall be defined and administered according to this Compact.


2. Funding: The United States agrees that it receives substantial benefit from the establishment and administration of the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area, and that the national and international public benefit extends far beyond the boundaries of the state. Thus, the United States agrees that the relatively small population of the state should not bear the entire cost of protection of the United States' reserved water right. To this end, the Department of the Interior agrees, subject to appropriations by Congress, to reimburse the state for the expense of establishment, administration and enforcement of the Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area by the Department;  to fund the inventory, sampling, reporting and database management by the Bureau;  and, except as provided in Article IV, section J.1.c., to fund the administrative costs and the cost of any study or any other necessary activity pursuant to this Article by the Technical Oversight Committee.


3. Implementation Contingent on Funds: Such funding shall be accomplished pursuant to the terms and conditions of a separate agreement which shall incorporate terms and conditions necessary to specify the activities to be funded and appropriate cost and accounting principles consistent with generally applicable guidelines for federal funding in similar circumstances, and consistent with the terms of this Compact, including, but not limited to, the enumeration of state expenses to be reimbursed in Article IV, section C.2. The state is relieved of its obligation to establish, administer, inventory, sample and maintain a database on the Controlled Groundwater Area in the absence of a funding agreement and the provision of the funds specified therein. If the state is relieved of its obligation to implement all or a portion of this Article, all other terms of this Compact shall remain in effect, including all reserved water rights established herein. Such agreement may be amended, extended, renewed or terminated pursuant to its terms.


4. Interim Measures:
The state agrees that the following interim measures shall apply from the effective date of this Compact until the receipt of funds from the United States or December 31, 1995, whichever occurs first. The United States agrees to reimburse the state for the cost of the interim measures, subject to the appropriation of funds by Congress. The parties agree that, even if funding is not received by December 31, 1995 and interim measures are suspended, the state and the Department of the Interior will continue to recommend federal funding.

a. The Department shall issue the notice required by Article IV, section F.


b. All permits issued within this time period within the Area shall be conditioned on appropriation of water of less than 60° F., measured at the wellhead.


c. The Department shall require that each applicant for a permit or person filing a notice of completion for issuance of a certificate of water right to appropriate groundwater within the Area report the following information on filing of a well log: (1) well location to the quarter-quarter-quarter-quarter section;  (2) ground elevation at the wellhead;  (3) well depth;  (4) water level;  (5) flow rate or maximum pump capacity;  and (6) water temperature measured at the wellhead.


d. The Department shall not issue a certificate of water right for the appropriation of groundwater with a temperature of 60° F. or more within the Area during this time period. The Department shall order temporary abandonment of any well in the Area for which a conditional permit was issued or notice of completion for issuance of a certificate of water right was filed within this time period that produces groundwater with a temperature of 60° F. or more, measured at the wellhead. Temporary abandonment shall be according to the rules of the Montana Board of Water Well Contractors.


e. Following receipt of funds from the United States, the Department shall notify the applicant that the appropriation is subject to the terms of this Compact and shall proceed according to the procedures set forth in this Article. If funds are not received by December 31, 1995, the Department may remove the order of temporary abandonment and remove the condition on the permit or issue the certificate of water right pursuant to state law. The Department shall continue to require that each applicant for a permit or certificate of water right to appropriate groundwater within the Area report the following information on filing of a well log: (1) well location to the quarter-quarter-quarter-quarter section;  (2) ground elevation at the wellhead;  (3) well depth;  (4) water level;  (5) flow rate or maximum pump capacity;  and (6) water temperature measured at the wellhead.



5. Additional Studies: In addition to appropriations necessary to implement this Article, the state and the National Park Service agree to recommend federal funding for a baseline study of hydrothermal features in YNP and within the Controlled Groundwater Area, for continued monitoring of these features, and for geologic and geophysical studies including, but not limited to, geologic mapping, and monitoring of microearthquakes and subsidence in and adjacent to YNP. Implementation of this Article is not contingent on such appropriation.


6. Access for Studies: Consistent with the purposes of YNP, the United States agrees to allow reasonable access to and across YNP to the extent necessary to accomplish the data collection authorized by this Article or additional studies recommended pursuant to Article IV, section C.5. In seeking access, the Department or Bureau shall comply with the provisions of Article II, section I.3.


7. Effect of Modification of Area: It is the intent of the parties that the initial boundaries of the Area set forth in Article IV, section D. and Appendix 3, and initial restrictions set forth in Article IV, section E. may be modified pursuant to Article IV, section J., or with respect to a single appropriation pursuant to Article IV, section G.2.c. and shall not be deemed to be a modification of this Compact. Any other modification of this Article shall be considered a modification of this Compact and is subject to the terms of Article VI, section A.2.


8. It is the intention of the Department of the Interior to protect the hydrothermal resources of Yellowstone National Park through the system established by Article IV.

a. The National Park Service agrees, consistent with 
43 U.S.C. § 666
, that enforcement will not be sought against the holder of a water right recognized under state law with a priority date on or after January 1, 1993, unless the NPS has, in the first instance, sought enforcement through the state under the terms of this Compact.


b. Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraph, if the National Park Service, in its judgment, determines that circumstances warrant, nothing in this Compact prohibits the United States from petitioning a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive or declarative relief. Nothing in this Compact shall alter the courts' application of the test for injunctive relief;  neither shall the administrative determination by the National Park Service to seek relief in said court be deemed to establish or preclude any determination in such judicial proceedings. Prior to such an administrative determination, the National Park Service agrees that it will provide the State written notice and will identify a time frame during which it will await the State's efforts to address the concern.


c. As to an action against the holder of a right to withdraw groundwater recognized under state law with a priority date before January 1, 1993, the United States agrees that this Compact shall not be used or relied upon as evidence to show that: (1) a reserved water right of the United States exists appurtenant to any land other than the reserved land of YNP;  or (2) the priority date associated with any portion of reserved land of YNP is other than the date on which that portion of land was actually reserved.




1. Establishment: The Yellowstone Controlled Groundwater Area or “Area” is hereby established and shall be defined and administered according to this Compact.

ix. Within 60 days of completion of the appropriation, the permittee shall file a notice of completion with the Department pursuant to state law.



c. Appropriation of Groundwater with a Temperature of 60° F. or Greater



If an application or registration for a permit within the Area is for a use requiring groundwater with a temperature of 60° F. or more or the well log or any verification indicates water of 60° F. or more, the following provisions apply:

i. Subarea I--groundwater with a temperature of 85° F. or more:

Groundwater of 85° F. or more in Subarea I is presumed to be hydrothermal discharge water. The Department shall not process or grant an application for a permit to appropriate water with a temperature of 85° F. or more in Subarea I, unless the appropriation is consistent with modification of restrictions pursuant to Article IV, section J., or pursuant to the procedures set forth below. An application for an appropriation that proposes to do no more than divert the unenhanced natural surface flow of a spring that is not located in the mainstem of the reserved portion of a stream to which a reserved water right for instream flow is described in Article III of this Compact is not subject to these restrictions.

(1) The application shall set forth credible information that the proposed appropriation does not include contribution by hydrothermal discharge water;


(2) Within 30 days of receipt of the information the Department shall seek review of the application by the TOC.


(3) The TOC shall review the report to determine if the appropriation can take place without adverse effect on the hydrothermal system within YNP. In performing the review, the TOC shall utilize the best available scientific information. The TOC shall resolve doubt in favor of protection of the hydrothermal system within YNP.


(4) Within 60 days of the request by the Department, the TOC shall recommend, in a report to the Department, if, and under what conditions the appropriation could be allowed without adverse effect on the hydrothermal system within YNP. The TOC may recommend limits or conditions on the proposed appropriation that, in the opinion of the TOC, would allow the development while protecting the hydrothermal system within YNP. The TOC shall also provide the Department with a dissenting report pursuant to Article IV, section J.1., if applicable.


(5) On receipt of the report or reports, the Department shall provide a copy to the United States and the applicant and shall schedule a hearing no less than 60 and no more than 90 days from mailing of the report.


(6) The hearing shall proceed as a contested case under the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, Title 2, Chapter 4 of the Montana Code Annotated.


(7) The report or reports, data and other written information produced by the TOC shall be admissible in the hearing without further foundation and not subject to the hearsay objection, subject to the rights of any party or claimant to cross-examine the producer or drafter of the written material and to controvert the same by other evidence. The hearing officer may request that members of the TOC appear to provide expert testimony in the case.


(8) The report and recommendations provided by the TOC have a rebuttable presumption of validity for the purposes of Article IV. The dissenting report, if any, may be used as rebuttal evidence.


(9) If the report recommends denial of the application, the applicant may overcome the presumption by proving by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed appropriation does not include hydrothermal discharge water.


(10) If the application is denied, the Department shall order that the well be temporarily abandoned;  or, if multiple water zones are encountered, the zone of excess temperature be closed to production. Abandonment shall be according to the rules of the Montana Board of Water Well Contractors unless alternative procedures are recommended by the TOC. The abandonment order shall not be lifted until a modification order pursuant to Section IV.J. allows the appropriation or until the department determines that the well should be permanently abandoned.


(11) Within 30 days of an order by the Department pursuant to this section, appeal on the record may be made to a state or federal court of competent jurisdiction. For an appeal to state court, venue shall be the First Judicial District in Helena and the review must be conducted according to the procedures for judicial review of a contested case under the Montana Administrative Procedures Act, Title 2, Chapter 4, of the Montana Code Annotated.

ii. Subarea I--groundwater with a temperature of 60° F. or more, but less than 85° F:


Appropriation of groundwater with a temperature of 60° F. or more, but less than 85° F. in subarea I is subject to the following provisions.

(1) The applicant shall provide credible information that the water meets the following criteria:

(a) the proposed appropriation will do no more than divert the unenhanced natural surface flow of a spring that is not located in the mainstem of the reserved portion of a stream to which a reserved water right for instream flow is described in Article III of this Compact, or


(b) the proposed appropriation meets all of the following criteria:

(i) The water temperature is the result of the normal thermal gradient of the earth plus the mean annual air temperature at the site plus 14° F. Unless modified by the TOC, the Department shall use the following equation to estimate the water temperature expected:

(0.01646 x the depth of the production zone in feet) + 59.3° F.
If the temperature measured at the wellhead is equal to or less than the temperature estimated by this equation, the appropriation meets this criteria.

(ii) the concentration of soluble chloride is less than ten parts per million;  and


(iii) the well does not contain a production zone completed within the Madison Group of formations as defined by the Catalog of Stratigraphic Names for Montana, Bureau of Mines and Geology, Special Publication 54, March 1971.




(2) The Department may issue a permit to appropriate groundwater with a temperature of 60° F or more, but less than 85° F. to an applicant that meets the above criteria and is in compliance with the provisions of Article IV, section G.2.c. unless (a) restrictions are consistent with modification pursuant to Article IV, section J.;  or (b) the United States objects and shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the criteria have not been met or, for another scientific reason, the temperature is the result of contribution by hydrothermal discharge water.


(3) If the applicant fails to meet the above criteria or the United States meets its burden, the applicant shall comply with the provisions of Article IV, section G.2.c.i. for water or 85° F or more.


(4) The three criteria set forth in Article IV, section G.2.c.ii.(1)(b) may be modified on recommendation by the TOC.

iii. Subarea II:

(1) Groundwater of 85° F. or more in subarea II is presumed to be hydrothermal discharge water. The applicant shall follow the procedures of Article IV, section G.2.c.i. including review by the TOC, provided that, if a permit to appropriate is issued the monitoring recommended in the Working Group Report or as superseded by the TOC for subarea II, not subarea I, shall apply.


(2) An applicant who encounters groundwater of 60° F. or more but less than 85° F. shall comply with the provisions of Article IV, section G.2.c.ii., provided that, if a permit to appropriate is issued the monitoring recommended in the Working Group Report or as superseded by the TOC for subarea II, not subarea I, shall apply.

3. Change in Character of Groundwater: Within 60 days of the receipt of information indicating a change in the character of the groundwater appropriated under a permit issued in the Area on or after January 1, 1993 that indicates the production of groundwater for which a restriction applies, the Department shall issue an order requiring that the appropriator comply with the limitations on appropriation of hydrothermal groundwater authorized in this Article. The order shall take affect 60 days following the date issued unless the appropriator appears to contest the order. If the appropriator appears to contest the order, the Department shall set a date for a hearing and proceed pursuant to the provisions for a contested case under the Montana Administrative Procedures Act, title 2, Chapter 4, of the Montana Code Annotated, provided that the appropriator shall have the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the water produced does not meet the criteria to which restrictions apply.




1. Appropriation of Groundwater within the Area with a Priority Date on or after January 1, 1993 and before the Effective Date of this Compact:
