(1)  (a) In the case of improvements of public ways, the benefited property shall consist of all real property abutting upon both sides of the improvement project, and the cost of improving intersections shall be included in the total costs to be assessed and apportioned, unless and to the extent the city shall appropriate, within constitutional limitations, from available funds, a definite and specified sum as a contribution thereto, or a portion of the aggregate cost, or the cost of specified portions of the improvement;  provided, however, that if provisions shall be made for sidewalk improvements, as an integral part of the improvement of a “public way,” as defined in subsection (3) of 
KRS 107.020
, upon only one side of the project, the costs of the sidewalk improvement shall be ascertained and assessed separately against the property abutting upon that side only, but the governing body may provide that such assessment shall include a fair share of the over-all costs as herein defined, other than the amounts of the actual construction contracts.


(b) In the case of improvements for draining sewage, storm water, or a combination thereof, the benefited properties shall consist of all properties which are thereby afforded a means of drainage, including not only the properties which may be contiguous to the improvements, but also adjacent properties within a reasonable distance therefrom as the governing body may in the proceedings set forth.


(c) In the case of an improvement project consisting in whole or in part of a sewage treatment plant, or enlargement or substantial reconstruction of an existing sewage treatment plant, the benefited properties shall be all those properties the sewage from which is treated in such plant, including properties already provided with sewer drainage facilities as well as those properties which the improvement project will provide with such drainage facilities, but the governing body may classify properties according to the extent of benefits to be afforded to them, and may establish one (1) rate of assessment applicable to all properties participating in the benefits of the sewage treatment installations, and an additional rate of assessment applicable to properties for which the improvement project will also provide sewer drainage facilities.  In relation to wastewater collection projects constructed by metropolitan sewer districts, benefited property shall consist of all property whether improved or unimproved to which the project affords a means of discharging wastewater.


(d) The governing body may, either in the proceedings initiating an improvement project, or in subsequent proceedings, recognize the necessity or desirability in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare, that properties other than the properties originally benefited by an improvement under paragraphs (b) or (c) of this subsection, be permitted to connect to such sewer drainage and/or treatment facilities, and may make equitable provisions which may be adjustable from year to year as bonds are retired, whereby the owners of such later-connecting properties, may, by paying charges for the privilege of connecting, and/or by assuming a share of improvement assessments, or otherwise, be placed as nearly as practicable on a basis of financial equity with the owners of properties initially provided to be assessed.


(e) The governing body may, either in the proceedings initiating an improvement project, or in subsequent proceedings, recognize the necessity or desirability in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare that residential properties within one thousand feet (1000'), measured along paved roads, of a fire hydrant in cities with a population of less than twenty thousand (20,000) based upon the most recent federal decennial census may be assessed on the same basis as property abutting upon a street where a fire hydrant is to be installed.



(1)  (a) In the case of improvements of public ways, the benefited property shall consist of all real property abutting upon both sides of the improvement project, and the cost of improving intersections shall be included in the total costs to be assessed and apportioned, unless and to the extent the city shall appropriate, within constitutional limitations, from available funds, a definite and specified sum as a contribution thereto, or a portion of the aggregate cost, or the cost of specified portions of the improvement;  provided, however, that if provisions shall be made for sidewalk improvements, as an integral part of the improvement of a “public way,” as defined in subsection (3) of

(c) In the case of an improvement project consisting in whole or in part of a sewage treatment plant, or enlargement or substantial reconstruction of an existing sewage treatment plant, the benefited properties shall be all those properties the sewage from which is treated in such plant, including properties already provided with sewer drainage facilities as well as those properties which the improvement project will provide with such drainage facilities, but the governing body may classify properties according to the extent of benefits to be afforded to them, and may establish one (1) rate of assessment applicable to all properties participating in the benefits of the sewage treatment installations, and an additional rate of assessment applicable to properties for which the improvement project will also provide sewer drainage facilities.  In relation to wastewater collection projects constructed by metropolitan sewer districts, benefited property shall consist of all property whether improved or unimproved to which the project affords a means of discharging wastewater.

(e) The governing body may, either in the proceedings initiating an improvement project, or in subsequent proceedings, recognize the necessity or desirability in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare that residential properties within one thousand feet (1000'), measured along paved roads, of a fire hydrant in cities with a population of less than twenty thousand (20,000) based upon the most recent federal decennial census may be assessed on the same basis as property abutting upon a street where a fire hydrant is to be installed.



(2)  (a) Benefited property owned by the city or county, or owned by the United States government or any of its agencies, if such property is subject to assessment by Act of Congress, shall be assessed annually the same as private property, and the amount of the annual assessment shall be paid by the city, county, or United States government, as the case may be.  The same right of action shall lie against the county as against a private owner.


(b) Benefited property owned by the state, except property the title to which is vested in the Commonwealth for the benefit of a district board of education pursuant to 
KRS 162.010
, shall be assessed as follows:  Before assessing the state, the governing body shall serve written notice on the secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet setting forth specific details including the estimated total amount of any improvement assessment proposed to be levied against any state property relative to any proposed improvement project.  Said written notice shall be served prior to the next even-numbered-year regular session of the General Assembly so that the amount of any specific improvement assessment may be included in the biennial executive branch budget recommendation to be submitted to the General Assembly.  Payment of any assessment shall be made only from funds specifically appropriated for that assessment.  If an amount sufficient to pay the total amount of any assessment has been appropriated, then the total amount shall be paid;  if an amount sufficient only to pay annual assessments has been appropriated, then only the amount of the annual assessment shall be paid.  The amount of the assessment shall be certified by the city treasurer to the Finance and Administration Cabinet, which shall thereupon draw a warrant upon the State Treasurer, payable to the city treasurer, and the State Treasurer shall pay the same.


(c) In the case of property the title to which is vested in the Commonwealth for the benefit of a district board of education, the amount of the annual assessment shall be paid by the city or other local governmental agency or authority which undertook the improvement project.

(1)  The board may approve, modify, or deny any application for a conditional use permit.  If it approves such permit it may attach necessary conditions such as time limitations, requirements that one (1) or more things be done before the request can be initiated, or conditions of a continuing nature.  Any such conditions shall be recorded in the board's minutes and on the conditional use permit, along with a reference to the specific section in the zoning regulation listing the conditional use under consideration.  The board shall have power to revoke conditional use permits, or variances for noncompliance with the condition thereof.  Furthermore, the board shall have a right of action to compel offending structures or uses removed at the cost of the violator and may have judgment in personam for such cost.



(2)  (a) Granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant from complying with all of the requirements of building, housing, and other regulations.


(b) If the applicant submits a modified plan to the relevant regulatory authorities in order to comply with all of the requirements of building, housing, and other regulations that expands the applicant's conditional use beyond the previously established geographic boundaries of the original conditional use permit, then the expanded conditional use shall be reviewed by the board.  This review shall be limited to an examination solely of the expanded geographic boundaries of the modified plan.  The board may deny the applicant's conditional use permit for the expanded geographic area.


(c) The applicant shall have the duty of informing the board of modifications made in accordance with paragraph (b) of this subsection, within fourteen (14) days of their submission.  The applicant's failure to provide the board with notification shall be grounds for the board to revoke the conditional use permit, after a hearing before the board.



(2)  (a) Granting of a conditional use permit does not exempt the applicant from complying with all of the requirements of building, housing, and other regulations.


(b) If the applicant submits a modified plan to the relevant regulatory authorities in order to comply with all of the requirements of building, housing, and other regulations that expands the applicant's conditional use beyond the previously established geographic boundaries of the original conditional use permit, then the expanded conditional use shall be reviewed by the board.  This review shall be limited to an examination solely of the expanded geographic boundaries of the modified plan.  The board may deny the applicant's conditional use permit for the expanded geographic area.


(c) The applicant shall have the duty of informing the board of modifications made in accordance with paragraph (b) of this subsection, within fourteen (14) days of their submission.  The applicant's failure to provide the board with notification shall be grounds for the board to revoke the conditional use permit, after a hearing before the board.


(3)  In any case where a conditional use permit has not been exercised within the time limit set by the board, or within one (1) year if no specific time limit has been set, such conditional use permit shall not revert to its original designation unless there has been a public hearing.  “Exercised,” as set forth in this section, shall mean that binding contracts for the construction of the main building or other improvement have been let;  or in the absence of contracts that the main building or other improvement is under construction to a substantial degree, or that prerequisite conditions involving substantial investment under contract, in development, are completed.  When construction is not a part of the use, “exercised” shall mean that the use is in operation in compliance with the conditions as set forth in the permit.


(4)  The administrative official shall review all conditional use permits, except those for which all conditions have been permanently satisfied, at least once annually and shall have the power to inspect the land or structure where the conditional use is located in order to ascertain that the landowner is complying with all of the conditions which are listed on the conditional use permit.  If the landowner is not complying with all of the conditions listed on the conditional use permit, the administrative official shall report the fact in writing to the chairman of the board of adjustment.  The report shall state specifically the manner in which the landowner is not complying with the conditions on the conditional use permit, and a copy of the report shall be furnished to the landowner at the same time that it is furnished to the chairman of the board of adjustment.  The board shall hold a hearing on the report within a reasonable time, and notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be furnished to the landowner at least one (1) week prior to the hearing.  If the board of adjustment finds that the facts alleged in the report of the administrative official are true and that the landowner has taken no steps to comply with them between the date of the report and the date of the hearing, the board of adjustment may authorize the administrative official to revoke the conditional use permit and take the necessary legal action to cause the termination of the activity on the land which the conditional use permit authorizes.


(5)  Once the board of adjustment has completed a conditional use permit and all the conditions required are of such type that they can be completely and permanently satisfied, the administrative official, upon request of the applicant, may, if the facts warrant, make a determination that the conditions have been satisfied, and enter the facts which indicate that the conditions have been satisfied and the conclusion in the margin of the copy of the conditional use permit which is on file.  Thereafter said use, if it continues to meet the other requirements of the regulations, will be treated as a permitted use.


(6)  When an application is made for a conditional use permit for land located within or abutting any residential zoning district, written notice shall be given at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the public hearing on the application to the applicant, administrative official, the mayor and city clerk of any city with a population of less than three thousand (3,000) based upon the most recent federal decennial census so affected within any county containing a consolidated local government, an owner of every parcel of property adjoining the property to which the application applies, and such other persons as the local zoning ordinance, regulations, or board of adjustment bylaws shall direct.  Written notice shall be by first-class mail with certification by the board's secretary or other officer that the notice was mailed.  It shall be the duty of the applicant to furnish to the board the name and address of an owner of each parcel of property as described in this subsection.  Records maintained by the property valuation administrator may be relied upon conclusively to determine the identity and address of said owner.  In the event such property is in condominium or cooperative forms of ownership, then the person notified by mail shall be the president or chairperson of the owner group which administers property commonly owned by the condominium or cooperative owners.  A joint notice may be mailed to two (2) or more co-owners of an adjoining property who are listed in the property valuation administrator's records as having the same address.


(7)  When any property within the required notification area for a public hearing upon a conditional use permit application is located within an adjoining city, county, or planning unit, notice of the hearing shall be given at least fourteen (14) days in advance of the hearing, by first-class mail to certain public officials, as follows:

(a) If the adjoining property is part of a planning unit, notice shall be given to that unit's planning commission;  or


(b) If the adjoining property is not part of a planning unit, notice shall be given to the mayor of the city in which the property is located or, if the property is in an unincorporated area, notice shall be given to the judge/executive of the county in which the property is located.



(a) If the adjoining property is part of a planning unit, notice shall be given to that unit's planning commission;  or


(b) If the adjoining property is not part of a planning unit, notice shall be given to the mayor of the city in which the property is located or, if the property is in an unincorporated area, notice shall be given to the judge/executive of the county in which the property is located.

(2)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, within thirty (30) days after July 15, 1988, the cabinet shall list the following compounds as hazardous wastes for the purposes of regulation of the treatment, storage, and disposal of the wastes under the delegated authority of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 
42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.
:  GB (isopropyl methyl phosphonoflouridate);  VX (O-ethyl-S-(2-diisopropylaminoethyl) methyl phosphonothiolate);  and H (bis(2-chloroethyl) sulfide) and related compounds.

KRS 224.46-520(1)
, the cabinet shall consider the criteria set forth in this subsection in making a determination to issue, deny, or condition a permit for any person desiring a permit to construct or operate a hazardous-waste site or facility for treatment or disposal of any of the compounds identified in subsection (2) of this section.  The applicant shall affirmatively demonstrate, and the cabinet shall find prior to issuance, conditional issuance, or denial of the permit or draft permit, that:

(a) The proposed treatment or destruction technology has been fully proven in an operational facility of scale, configuration, and throughput comparable to the proposed facility, or has been demonstrated as effective, within the chemical weapons disposal programs as directed in 
Pub. L. 104-208
 and other applicable federal laws, sufficient to provide assurance of destruction or neutralization and removal efficiency of ninety-nine and nine thousand, nine hundred, and ninety-nine ten thousandths percent (99.9999%) for each compound listed in subsection (2) of this section that is proposed to be treated or destroyed, with the efficiency to be demonstrated as achievable under all operating conditions.  During the occurrence of malfunctions, upsets, or unplanned shutdowns, all quantities of any compound listed in subsection (2) of this section shall be contained, reprocessed or otherwise controlled so as to ensure that the required efficiency is attained prior to any release to the environment;


(b) Monitoring data from an operational facility or alternative disposal program as described in paragraph (a) of this subsection reflects that the emissions from treatment and destruction facilities or fugitive sources, including, but not limited to, the emissions of the compounds identified in subsection (2) of this section and products of combustion, incomplete combustion, and other processes alone or in combination present no more than a minimal risk of acute or chronic human health effect, as demonstrated by sufficient and applicable toxicological data, or adverse environmental effect;  and


(c) An emergency response plan has been submitted to the cabinet and approved, after public notice and an opportunity to be heard, providing for sufficient training, coordination, and equipment for state and local emergency response personnel, including health, police, fire, and other responders, to assure the ability of the community to respond to releases from such a facility.  The plan shall demonstrate the capability of evacuating prior to exposure, or otherwise mitigating exposure for all individuals that might be exposed to releases from the facility during a credible worst-case release.  In determining the population and area of potential exposure during a worst-case release, all possible climatic conditions and population distributions shall be assumed for the largest area where any exposure to the release could induce acute or chronic health consequences or environmental impact.  If such a plan has not been fully implemented at the time of permit approval, the Division of Emergency Management shall advise the cabinet of critical shortcomings.  Any permit issued shall include, as conditions, the resolution of critical shortcomings in the implementation of the plan, and shall not allow actual destruction of any of the compounds identified in subsection (2) of this section to begin until those permit conditions have been met to the satisfaction of the Division of Emergency Management.  No later than January 1, 2001, the Division of Emergency Management shall complete an assessment of a draft plan previously submitted by the applicant and the respective counties and, after public notice and an opportunity to be heard, shall approve or reject the draft plan.  The cabinet shall conduct no technical review of a permit application for treatment or disposal of these compounds until notified in writing by the Division of Emergency Management that the draft plan has been approved.



(a) The proposed treatment or destruction technology has been fully proven in an operational facility of scale, configuration, and throughput comparable to the proposed facility, or has been demonstrated as effective, within the chemical weapons disposal programs as directed in

KRS 224.46-520(1)
, the cabinet makes an affirmative finding after public notice and an opportunity to be heard, that no alternative method of treatment or disposal exists in an operational facility or alternative disposal program as described in subsection (3)(a) of this section that create less risk of release, or acute or chronic health effect, or adverse environmental effect.


(5)  In addition to the definition of the term as defined in this chapter, the term “treatment,” as used in this section, shall include the manual or mechanical handling of the chemical compounds listed in subsection (2) of this section and of any munitions containing the compounds during the processing of munitions to remove the compounds, to separate munitions components, and to otherwise prepare the components and compounds for destruction, neutralization, dismantling, or decommissioning.  The term “treatment” shall not include the handling, movement, or overpacking of containers or munitions containing a compound listed in subsection (2) of this section within the fenced boundaries of an area used for the storage of those munitions if:

(a) A plan for the handling, movement, or overpacking is submitted and approved by the cabinet, after public notice and opportunity to be heard, before the handling, movement, or overpacking occurs;  or


(b) An emergency has occurred and the handling, movement, or overpacking is necessary to protect human health, safety, or the environment, if a report describing the handling, movement, or overpacking is submitted to the cabinet as soon as possible after the emergency is abated.

(8)  In addition to other requirements of 
KRS 224.46-520(1)
 and 
subsections (1)
 to 
(6)
 of this section, the cabinet shall not issue a permit or authorization to construct or operate a hazardous waste site or facility for treatment or disposal of any of the compounds identified in subsection (2) of this section unless the applicant provides written documentation from the host county certifying that:

(a) All infrastructure improvements identified in the final emergency response plan required in subsection (3)(c) of this section as being reasonably necessary to assure the ability of the community to effectively respond to releases from the facility in order to protect public health and the environment under the emergency response plan, have been or will be completed by the applicant prior to operation of the facility;  and


(b) The applicant has provided to the host county sufficient funding for reasonable direct and indirect costs of the creation and maintenance of the position of host community liaison.  The host community liaison will be determined by the host county and will act as the single point of contact for community relations, emergency planning, and community oversight of the construction, operation, closure, and emergency response of the facility.

Kentucky Revised Statutes Title XIII. Education § 160.048. Transfer of area containing school outside district,https://codes.findlaw.com/ky/title-xiii-education/ky-rev-st-sect-160-048.html,"
(1)  The General Assembly hereby finds that from time to time various school boards, in the exercise of their administrative discretion, have determined that their school districts would be most efficiently administered if one (1) or more of the district's schools were constructed and operated on land located outside the school districts' boundaries.  The General Assembly further finds that this has been desirable and in furtherance of an efficient system of common schools.  As urbanization increases, and school districts throughout the Commonwealth become more densely populated, available school sites within such districts will proportionately diminish, and it will with increasing frequency be necessary to construct schools on land not within the district of the school board constructing such schools.  When a school is so located, it is more efficient for the school district constructing the school, but it is less efficient for the statewide system of common schools and for the children residing in the immediate neighborhood of the new school, who reside in a different school district, and therefore must be transported to other, more distant schools.  This situation results in an inefficient utilization of state and local school funds and school facilities, and is a result of the artificially-drawn school district boundary lines.  The General Assembly further finds that the discretionary method of transfer presently provided by 
KRS 160.045
 is not adequate to assure an efficient operation of the common schools, and that it is desirable to provide for mandatory transfer of such areas.  Pursuant to 
section 183 of the Kentucky Constitution
, the General Assembly declares that such situations are special situations and require special treatment.  It is the intent of the General Assembly to provide by this statute a special method whereby such areas may be transferred to the school district operating the school or schools.


(2)  If seventy-five percent (75%) of either the registered voters or property owners in an area adjacent to a school district other than the district in which such area is located and in which area there is located a school owned and operated by such adjacent school district petition the school board of the school district which owns and operates such school and the school board of the school district in which such area is located for the transfer of such area from the school district in which it is located to the school district which owns and operates such school, then such area shall be so transferred.


(3)  The effective date of such transfer shall be sixty (60) days after the date on which the petition is filed with the two (2) school boards;  personal delivery of said petition to any member of the school board or to the superintendent of the school district shall constitute “filing” for purposes of this section.  Provided, that if such effective date falls during a term of the school district in which such area is located, the two (2) school boards involved may, by agreement, defer the effective date of such transfer until the end of said term.


(4)  The terms and conditions of such transfer shall be determined in the manner provided for the determination of the terms and conditions of transfer under 
KRS 160.045
, except that the chief state school officer, the Kentucky Board of Education, and the respective reviewing courts shall have no power to disapprove such transfer.


(5)  Upon such transfer, the recipient district shall assume a portion of the bonded indebtedness of the losing district, as provided in 
KRS 160.065
;  such bonds shall remain the obligation of the issuing agency, and shall not be affected in any way by such transfer, except that each year the recipient district shall pay to the losing district a sum of money sufficient to make the payments on the portion of such indebtedness assumed by the recipient district, and such annual payments shall continue until all of the bonded indebtedness outstanding at the time of the transfer is paid in full.


(6)  The method of transfer provided in this section shall be an alternative method to that set forth in 
KRS 160.045
, and this section shall have no effect whatsoever on 
KRS 160.045
.

Kentucky Revised Statutes Title XIII. Education § 161.124. Interstate Agreement on Qualification of Educational Personnel,https://codes.findlaw.com/ky/title-xiii-education/ky-rev-st-sect-161-124.html,"ARTICLE I. PURPOSE, FINDINGS, AND POLICY(1) The states party to this agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of these persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession.  It is the purpose of this agreement to provide for the development and execution of these programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the states party to it, and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.
(2) The party states find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations.  Variations from state to state in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage these personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other states.  As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems.  Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their states of origin, can increase the available educational resources.  Participation in this compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONSAs used in this agreement and contracts made pursuant to it, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

(1) “Educational personnel” means persons who must meet requirements pursuant to state law as a condition of employment in educational programs.


(2) “Designated state official” means the education official of a state selected by that state to negotiate and enter into, on behalf of his state, contracts pursuant to this agreement.


(3) “Accept,” or any variant thereof, means to recognize and give effect to one (1) or more determinations of another state relating to the qualifications of educational personnel in lieu of making or requiring a like determination that would otherwise be required by or pursuant to the laws of a receiving state.


(4) “State” means a state, territory, or possession of the United States;  the District of Columbia;  or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.


(5) “Originating state” means a state and its subdivisions, if any, whose determination that certain educational personnel are qualified to be employed for specific duties in schools is acceptable in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.


(6) “Receiving state” means a state and its subdivisions which accept educational personnel in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.

ARTICLE III. INTERSTATE EDUCATIONAL PERSONNEL CONTRACTS(1) The designated state official of a party state may make one or more contracts on behalf of his state with one or more other party states providing for the acceptance of educational personnel.  Any contract for the period of its duration shall be applicable to and binding on the states whose designated state officials enter into it, and the subdivisions of those states, with the same force and effect as if incorporated in this agreement.  A designated state official may enter into a contract pursuant to this Article only with states in which he finds that there are programs of education, certification standards or other acceptable qualifications that assure preparation or qualification of educational personnel on a basis sufficiently comparable, even though not identical to that prevailing in his own state.

(2) Any contract shall provide for:

(a) Its duration.


(b) The criteria to be applied by an originating state in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving state.


(c) Waivers, substitutions, and conditional acceptance as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract without sacrifice of basic educational standards.


(d) Any other necessary matters.



(a) Its duration.


(b) The criteria to be applied by an originating state in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving state.


(c) Waivers, substitutions, and conditional acceptance as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract without sacrifice of basic educational standards.


(d) Any other necessary matters.


(3) No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall be for a term longer than five years but any contract may be renewed for like or lesser periods.


(4) Any contract dealing with acceptance of educational personnel on the basis of their having completed an educational program shall specify the earliest date or dates on which originating state approval of the program or programs involved can have occurred.  No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall require acceptance by a receiving state of any persons qualified because of successful completion of a program prior to January 1, 1954.


(5) The certification or other acceptance of a person who has been accepted pursuant to the terms of a contract shall not be revoked or otherwise impaired because the contract has expired or been terminated.  However, any certificate or other qualifying document may be revoked or suspended on any ground which would be sufficient for revocation or suspension of a certificate or other qualifying document initially granted or approved in the receiving state.


(6) A contract committee composed of the designated state officials of the contracting states or their representatives shall keep the contract under continuous review, study means of improving its administration, and report no less frequently than once a year to the heads of the appropriate education agencies of the contracting states.

ARTICLE IV. APPROVED AND ACCEPTED PROGRAMS(1) Nothing in this agreement should be construed to repeal or otherwise modify any law or regulation of a party state relating to the approval of programs of educational preparation having effect solely on the qualification of educational personnel within that state.
(2) To the extent that contracts made pursuant to this agreement deal with the educational requirements for the proper qualification of educational personnel, acceptance of a program of educational preparation shall be in accordance with such procedures and requirements as may be provided in the applicable contract.ARTICLE V. INTERSTATE COOPERATIONThe party states agree that:

(1) They will, so far as practicable, prefer the making of multilateral contracts pursuant to Article III of this agreement.

(2) They will facilitate and strengthen cooperation in interstate certification and other elements of educational personnel qualification and for this purpose shall cooperate with agencies, organizations, and associations interested in certification and other elements of educational personnel qualification.ARTICLE VI. AGREEMENT EVALUATIONThe designated state officials of any party state may meet from time to time as a group to evaluate progress under the agreement, and to formulate recommendation for changes.ARTICLE VII. OTHER ARRANGEMENTSNothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent or inhibit other arrangements or practices of any party state or states to facilitate the interchange of educational personnel.
ARTICLE VIII. EFFECT AND WITHDRAWAL(1) This agreement shall become effective when enacted into law by two (2) states.  Thereafter it shall become effective as to any state upon its enactment of this agreement.

(2) Any party state may withdraw from this agreement by enacting a statute repealing the agreement, but no withdrawal shall take effect until one (1) year after the Governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the Governors of all other party states.

(3) No withdrawal shall relieve the withdrawing state of any obligation imposed upon it by a contract to which it is a party.  The duration of contracts and the methods and conditions of withdrawal therefrom shall be those specified in their terms.ARTICLE IX. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITYThis agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes.  The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the Constitution of any state or of the United States, or the application thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.  If this agreement shall be held contrary to the Constitution of any state participating therein, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters."

"Kentucky Revised Statutes Title IX. Counties, Cities, and Other Local Units § 109.011. Findings and declaration of purpose;  intent",https://codes.findlaw.com/ky/title-ix-counties-cities-and-other-local-units/ky-rev-st-sect-109-011.html,"
(1)  That an ever-increasing volume of solid waste both within and outside the Commonwealth is being generated as a result of increasing economic and commercial activity, continuing technological progress, and changes in methods of manufacturing, packaging, and marketing of consumer products, which results in additional solid wastes discarded by the users of these products;


(2)  That the continued economic and population growth of the Commonwealth has required increased industrial and commercial expansion and has made necessary the demolition of obsolete structures, the construction of new structures, the provision of highways and other avenues of transportation, and the construction and installation of public works which, together with pre-existing commercial, industrial, and agricultural operations, have resulted in the generation of further volumes of solid waste;


(3)  That the handling of solid wastes has been primarily carried out through the dumping of wastes on open soil and in landfills, which in some cases are inimical to the public health, safety, and welfare;


(4)  That by the enactment by the Congress of the United States of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (
Public Law 94-580
), as amended,  1 the collection, sanitary disposal, and recovery of solid waste has been determined to be a matter of nationwide importance, recognizing that the management of solid waste should continue to be primarily the function of state, regional, and local agencies;  and that pursuant to this federal law, the Commonwealth has taken and will take certain actions in respect to the planning and implementation of solid waste plans within the guidelines of time requirements set forth in this federal law;


(5)  That as a result of the conditions described in the foregoing findings, problems of solid waste collection, management, and treatment, and resource recovery activities in connection therewith have become a matter of statewide concern necessitating action by the General Assembly to:

(a) Enable responsible planning and management agencies to be created to define solid waste management requirements, with all of the foregoing subject to regulation by the Energy and Environment Cabinet;


(b) Assist those units of government primarily responsible for the management of solid waste and the acquisition, financing and operation of facilities to dispose of solid waste to fulfill their functions in a responsible and proper manner with primary emphasis on the regionalization of these functions;  and


(c) Reduce the amount of solid waste generated and disposed in Kentucky;



(a) Enable responsible planning and management agencies to be created to define solid waste management requirements, with all of the foregoing subject to regulation by the Energy and Environment Cabinet;


(b) Assist those units of government primarily responsible for the management of solid waste and the acquisition, financing and operation of facilities to dispose of solid waste to fulfill their functions in a responsible and proper manner with primary emphasis on the regionalization of these functions;  and


(c) Reduce the amount of solid waste generated and disposed in Kentucky;


(6)  That it is the intent of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky that the primary responsibility for adequate solid waste collection, management, treatment, disposal, and resource recovery shall rest with combinations of counties and waste management districts, subject to standards set by administrative regulations adopted by the Energy and Environment Cabinet.  In those cities currently operating solid waste management systems, the city and county may assume joint responsibility of preparing a solid waste management plan.  If it is in the best public interest to do so and with the mutual agreement of both the county and city, a county may delegate responsibility for adequate collection, management, treatment, disposal, or materials recovery to a city.  This delegation of responsibility is contingent upon the approval of a solid waste management plan by the cabinet.  The purpose of delegating responsibilities shall be to effectuate the safe and sanitary management, use, and handling of solid waste, the protection of the health, welfare, and safety of the citizens and inhabitants of the Commonwealth, and for making the most efficient use of all resources for the benefit of the citizens and inhabitants of the Commonwealth;


(7)  That the General Assembly recognizes the generation of solid waste is inevitable, but much of it is unnecessary and should be discouraged.  However, where solid waste does exist, it should be considered to the extent possible as a valuable resource, and be made use of wherever and whenever desirable and economically justifiable.  Therefore, it shall be the policy of the Commonwealth to, above all things, encourage resource conservation and preservation of our natural resources before waste contributes in a needless fashion to the volumes of solid waste and litter produced by our society;  but in dealing with existing solid waste, materials recovery from the solid waste stream is deemed to be the most environmentally sound alternative for handling waste;


(8)  It is not the intent of this chapter to prohibit or discourage the participation of the private sector in any aspect of solid waste management.  Moreover, it is preferable for solid waste management functions to be performed by the private sector when it is in the best interests of the public and conforms with the policies and provisions in this chapter;


(9)  It is the intent of the General Assembly that counties and waste management districts cooperate to develop and implement the solid waste management plans mandated by KRS Chapter 224 and the administrative regulations adopted by the cabinet with the goal of regionalizing the management of solid waste;


(10) It is the intent of the General Assembly that waste requiring disposal in municipal solid waste disposal facilities be reduced and that solid waste be managed in an environmentally protective manner;


(11) Notwithstanding any provision of KRS Chapters 82, 83, and 94, it is the intent of the General Assembly that this chapter and 
KRS 67.083(3)(o)
 provide counties with authority to develop a solid waste management system for solid waste generated within the geographical boundaries of the county, consistent with the provisions of this chapter and KRS Chapter 224.  It is further the intent of the General Assembly that cities be authorized to finance, own, and operate solid waste management systems with the consent of the county or by contract with the county, except that in the event a county fails to submit a solid waste management plan pursuant to KRS Chapter 224 cities may proceed to develop solid waste management systems consistent with administrative regulations adopted by the cabinet pursuant to KRS Chapter 224.  Cities that develop solid waste management facilities pursuant to this section shall have all the powers and restrictions set forth for counties in 
KRS 109.041
, 
109.056
, and 
109.059
;  and


(12) It is the intent of the General Assembly that waste management districts which are formed and operated under this chapter shall comply with the standards set by administrative regulations adopted by the cabinet pursuant to KRS Chapter 224.

2. Review party states' individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency;


3. Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans;


4. Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries;


5. Protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services, and resources, both human and material;

Limitations.Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof;  provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state.Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers, except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state, duties, rights, and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services.  Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance.  These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state emergency or disaster by the Governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect, or loaned resources remain in the receiving state, whichever is longer.ARTICLE V.

Compensation.Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.ARTICLE IX. Reimbursement.Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests;  provided, that any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost;  and provided further, that any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states.  Article VIII expenses shall not be reimbursable under this article.ARTICLE X. Evacuation.Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception for portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant, shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management/services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur.  Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing, and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors.  Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines, and medical care, and like items.  Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come.  After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees.
ARTICLE XI. Implementation.A. This compact shall become effective immediately upon its enactment into law by any two states.  Thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon enactment by such state.

B. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until thirty (30) days after the Governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the Governors of all other party states.  Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.

C. Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States Government.ARTICLE XII. Validity.This compact shall be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in Article I. If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional, or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected.ARTICLE XIII. Additional Provisions.Nothing in this compact shall authorize or permit the use of military force by the National Guard of a state at any place outside that state in any emergency for which the President is authorized by law to call into federal service the militia, or for any purpose for which the use of the Army or the Air Force would in the absence of express statutory authorization be prohibited under 
Section 1385 of Title 18 of the United States Code

(2)  Payments for hospital care, nursing-home care, and drugs or other medical, ophthalmic, podiatric, and dental supplies shall be on bases which relate the amount of the payment to the cost of providing the services or supplies.  It shall be one (1) of the functions of the council to make recommendations to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services with respect to the bases for payment.  In determining the rates of reimbursement for long-term-care facilities participating in the Medical Assistance Program, the Cabinet for Health and Family Services shall, to the extent permitted by federal law, not allow the following items to be considered as a cost to the facility for purposes of reimbursement:

(a) Motor vehicles that are not owned by the facility, including motor vehicles that are registered or owned by the facility but used primarily by the owner or family members thereof;


(b) The cost of motor vehicles, including vans or trucks, used for facility business shall be allowed up to fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) per facility, adjusted annually for inflation according to the increase in the consumer price index-u for the most recent twelve (12) month period, as determined by the United States Department of Labor.  Medically equipped motor vehicles, vans, or trucks shall be exempt from the fifteen thousand dollar ($15,000) limitation.  Costs exceeding this limit shall not be reimbursable and shall be borne by the facility.  Costs for additional motor vehicles, not to exceed a total of three (3) per facility, may be approved by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services if the facility demonstrates that each additional vehicle is necessary for the operation of the facility as required by regulations of the cabinet;

(d) The cost of contracts, loans, or other payments made by the facility to owners, administrators, or both, unless the payments are for services which would otherwise be necessary to the operation of the facility and the services are required by regulations of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services.  Any other payments shall be deemed part of the owner's compensation in accordance with maximum limits established by regulations of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services.  Interest paid to the facility for loans made to a third party may be used to offset allowable interest claimed by the facility;


(e) Private club memberships for owners or administrators, travel expenses for trips outside the state for owners or administrators, and other indirect payments made to the owner, unless the payments are deemed part of the owner's compensation in accordance with maximum limits established by regulations of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services;  and


(f) Payments made to related organizations supplying the facility with goods or services shall be limited to the actual cost of the goods or services to the related organization, unless it can be demonstrated that no relationship between the facility and the supplier exists.  A relationship shall be considered to exist when an individual, including brothers, sisters, father, mother, aunts, uncles, and in-laws, possesses a total of five percent (5%) or more of ownership equity in the facility and the supplying business.  An exception to the relationship shall exist if fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the supplier's business activity of the type carried on with the facility is transacted with persons and organizations other than the facility and its related organizations.



(a) Motor vehicles that are not owned by the facility, including motor vehicles that are registered or owned by the facility but used primarily by the owner or family members thereof;


(b) The cost of motor vehicles, including vans or trucks, used for facility business shall be allowed up to fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) per facility, adjusted annually for inflation according to the increase in the consumer price index-u for the most recent twelve (12) month period, as determined by the United States Department of Labor.  Medically equipped motor vehicles, vans, or trucks shall be exempt from the fifteen thousand dollar ($15,000) limitation.  Costs exceeding this limit shall not be reimbursable and shall be borne by the facility.  Costs for additional motor vehicles, not to exceed a total of three (3) per facility, may be approved by the Cabinet for Health and Family Services if the facility demonstrates that each additional vehicle is necessary for the operation of the facility as required by regulations of the cabinet;


(c) Salaries paid to immediate family members of the owner or administrator, or both, of a facility, to the extent that services are not actually performed and are not a necessary function as required by regulation of the cabinet for the operation of the facility.  The facility shall keep a record of all work actually performed by family members;


(d) The cost of contracts, loans, or other payments made by the facility to owners, administrators, or both, unless the payments are for services which would otherwise be necessary to the operation of the facility and the services are required by regulations of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services.  Any other payments shall be deemed part of the owner's compensation in accordance with maximum limits established by regulations of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services.  Interest paid to the facility for loans made to a third party may be used to offset allowable interest claimed by the facility;


(e) Private club memberships for owners or administrators, travel expenses for trips outside the state for owners or administrators, and other indirect payments made to the owner, unless the payments are deemed part of the owner's compensation in accordance with maximum limits established by regulations of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services;  and


(f) Payments made to related organizations supplying the facility with goods or services shall be limited to the actual cost of the goods or services to the related organization, unless it can be demonstrated that no relationship between the facility and the supplier exists.  A relationship shall be considered to exist when an individual, including brothers, sisters, father, mother, aunts, uncles, and in-laws, possesses a total of five percent (5%) or more of ownership equity in the facility and the supplying business.  An exception to the relationship shall exist if fifty-one percent (51%) or more of the supplier's business activity of the type carried on with the facility is transacted with persons and organizations other than the facility and its related organizations.


(3)  No vendor payment shall be made unless the class and type of medical care rendered and the cost basis therefor has first been designated by regulation.


(4)  The rules and regulations of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services shall require that a written statement, including the required opinion of a physician, shall accompany any claim for reimbursement for induced premature births.  This statement shall indicate the procedures used in providing the medical services.


(5)  The range of medical care benefit standards provided and the quality and quantity standards and the methods for determining cost formulae for vendor payments within each category of public assistance and other recipients shall be uniform for the entire state, and shall be designated by regulation promulgated within the limitations established by the Social Security Act and federal regulations.  It shall not be necessary that the amount of payments for units of services be uniform for the entire state but amounts may vary from county to county and from city to city, as well as among hospitals, based on the prevailing cost of medical care in each locale and other local economic and geographic conditions, except that insofar as allowed by applicable federal law and regulation, the maximum amounts reimbursable for similar services rendered by physicians within the same specialty of medical practice shall not vary according to the physician's place of residence or place of practice, as long as the place of practice is within the boundaries of the state.


(6)  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to deprive a woman of all appropriate medical care necessary to prevent her physical death.


(7)  To the extent permitted by federal law, no medical assistance recipient shall be recertified as qualifying for a level of long-term care below the recipient's current level, unless the recertification includes a physical examination conducted by a physician licensed pursuant to KRS Chapter 311 or by an advanced practice registered nurse licensed pursuant to KRS Chapter 314 and acting under the physician's supervision.


(8)  If payments made to community mental health centers, established pursuant to KRS Chapter 210, for services provided to the intellectually disabled exceed the actual cost of providing the service, the balance of the payments shall be used solely for the provision of other services to the intellectually disabled through community mental health centers.


(9)  No long-term-care facility, as defined in 
KRS 216.510
, providing inpatient care to recipients of medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act   1 on July 15, 1986, shall deny admission of a person to a bed certified for reimbursement under the provisions of the Medical Assistance Program solely on the basis of the person's paying status as a Medicaid recipient.  No person shall be removed or discharged from any facility solely because they became eligible for participation in the Medical Assistance Program, unless the facility can demonstrate the resident or the resident's responsible party was fully notified in writing that the resident was being admitted to a bed not certified for Medicaid reimbursement.  No facility may decertify a bed occupied by a Medicaid recipient or may decertify a bed that is occupied by a resident who has made application for medical assistance.


(10) Family-practice physicians practicing in geographic areas with no more than one (1) primary-care physician per five thousand (5,000) population, as reported by the United States Department of Health and Human Services, shall be reimbursed one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the standard reimbursement rate for physician services.


(11) The Cabinet for Health and Family Services shall make payments under the Medical Assistance program for services which are within the lawful scope of practice of a chiropractor licensed pursuant to KRS Chapter 312, to the extent the Medical Assistance Program pays for the same services provided by a physician.

(2)  The procedure with respect to the giving of notice and determination of claims in occupational disease cases and the compensation and medical benefits payable for disability or death due to the disease shall be the same as in cases of accidental injury or death under the general provisions of this chapter, except that notice of claim shall be given to the employer as soon as practicable after the employee first experiences a distinct manifestation of an occupational disease in the form of symptoms reasonably sufficient to apprise the employee that he or she has contracted the disease, or a diagnosis of the disease is first communicated to him or her, whichever shall first occur.


(3)  The procedure for filing occupational disease claims shall be as follows:

(a) The application for resolution of claim shall set forth the complete work history of the employee with a concise description of injurious exposure to a specific occupational disease, together with the name and addresses of the employer or employers with the approximate dates of employment.  The application shall also include at least one (1) written medical report supporting his or her claim.  This medical report shall be made on the basis of clinical or X-ray examination performed in accordance with accepted medical standards and shall contain full and complete statements of all examinations performed and the results thereof.  The report shall be made by a duly-licensed physician.  The commissioner shall promulgate administrative regulations which prescribe the format of the medical report required by this section and the manner in which the report shall be completed.

1. For coal-related occupational pneumoconiosis claims, each clinical examination shall include a chest X-ray interpretation by a National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certified “B” reader.  The chest X-ray upon which the report is made shall be filed with the application as well as spirometric tests when pulmonary dysfunction is alleged.


2. For other compensable occupational pneumoconiosis claims, each clinical examination shall include a chest X-ray examination and appropriate pulmonary function tests.



(b) To be admissible, medical evidence offered in any proceeding under this chapter for determining a claim for occupational pneumoconiosis resulting from exposure to coal dust shall comply with accepted medical standards as follows:

1. Chest X-rays shall be of acceptable quality with respect to exposure and development and shall be indelibly labeled with the date of the X-ray and the name and Social Security number of the claimant.  Physicians' reports of X-ray interpretations shall:  identify the claimant by name and Social Security number;  include the date of the X-ray and the date of the report;  classify the X-ray interpretation using the latest ILO Classification and be accompanied by a completed copy of the latest ILO Classification report.  Only interpretations by National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) certified “B” readers shall be admissible.


2. Spirometric testing shall be conducted in accordance with the standards recommended in the “Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment” and the 1978 ATS epidemiology standardization project with the exception that the predicted normal values for lung function shall not be adjusted based upon the race of the subject.  The FVC or the FEV1 values shall represent the largest of such values obtained from three (3) acceptable forced expiratory volume maneuvers as corrected to BTPS (body temperature, ambient pressure and saturated with water vapor at these conditions) and the variance between the two (2) largest acceptable FVC values shall be either less than five percent (5%) of the largest FVC value or less than one hundred (100) milliliters, whichever is greater.  The variance between the two (2) largest acceptable FEV1 values shall be either less than five percent (5%) of the largest FEV1 value or less than one hundred (100) milliliters, whichever is greater.  Reports of spirometric testing shall include a description by the physician of the procedures utilized in conducting such spirometric testing and a copy of the spirometric chart and tracings from which spirometric values submitted as evidence were taken.


3. The commissioner shall promulgate administrative regulations pursuant to KRS Chapter 13A as necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.  The commissioner shall periodically review the applicability of the spirometric test values contained in the “Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment” and may by administrative regulation substitute other spirometric test values which are found to be more closely representative of the normal pulmonary function of the coal mining population.

c. Except for coal workers' pneumoconiosis claims, within forty-five (45) days following the notice of filing an application for resolution of claim, the employer or carrier shall notify the commissioner and all parties of record of its acceptance or denial of the claim.  A denial shall be in writing and shall state the specific basis for the denial.  In coal workers' pneumoconiosis claims, the employer's notice of claim denial or acceptance shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the issuance by the commissioner of the notice of the consensus reading unless the consensus is that the miner has not developed coal workers' pneumoconiosis category 1/0 or greater.  In the event the consensus procedure is exhausted without consensus being established, the employer's notice of claim denial or acceptance shall be filed within thirty (30) days of the commissioner notification to the administrative law judge that consensus has not been reached.


d. Within forty-five (45) days of assignment of a coal workers' pneumoconiosis claim to an administrative law judge, the employer shall cause the employee to be examined by a physician of the employer's choice and shall provide to all other parties and file with the commissioner the X-ray interpretation by a “B” reader.  The examination of the employee shall include spirometric testing if pulmonary dysfunction is alleged by the employee in the application for resolution of a claim.  The commissioner shall determine whether the X-ray interpretations filed by the parties are in consensus.


e. If the readings are not in consensus, the commissioner shall forward both films, masking information identifying the facility where the X-ray was obtained and the referring physician, consecutively to three (3) “B” readers selected randomly from a list maintained by the commissioner for interpretation.  Each “B” reader shall select the highest quality film and report only the interpretation of that film.  The commissioner shall determine if two (2) of the X-ray interpretations filed by the three (3) “B” readers selected randomly are in consensus.  If consensus is reached, the commissioner shall forward copies of the report to all parties as well as notice of the consensus reading which shall be considered as evidence.  If consensus is not reached, the administrative law judge shall decide the claim on the evidence submitted.


f. “Consensus” is reached between two (2) chest X-ray interpreters when their classifications meet one (1) of the following criteria:  each finds either category A, B, or C progressive massive fibrosis;  or findings with regard to simple pneumoconiosis are both in the same major category and within one (1) minor category (ILO category twelve (12) point scale) of each other.


g. The administrative law judge shall conduct such proceedings as are necessary to resolve the claim and shall have authority to grant or deny any relief, including interlocutory relief, to order additional proof, to conduct a benefit review conference, or to take such other action as may be appropriate to resolve the claim.


h. Unless a voluntary settlement is reached by the parties, or the parties agree otherwise, the administrative law judge shall issue a written determination within sixty (60) days following a hearing.  The written determination shall address all contested issues and shall be enforceable under 
KRS 342.305

f. “Consensus” is reached between two (2) chest X-ray interpreters when their classifications meet one (1) of the following criteria:  each finds either category A, B, or C progressive massive fibrosis;  or findings with regard to simple pneumoconiosis are both in the same major category and within one (1) minor category (ILO category twelve (12) point scale) of each other.


g. The administrative law judge shall conduct such proceedings as are necessary to resolve the claim and shall have authority to grant or deny any relief, including interlocutory relief, to order additional proof, to conduct a benefit review conference, or to take such other action as may be appropriate to resolve the claim.


h. Unless a voluntary settlement is reached by the parties, or the parties agree otherwise, the administrative law judge shall issue a written determination within sixty (60) days following a hearing.  The written determination shall address all contested issues and shall be enforceable under

(13) For coal-related occupational pneumoconiosis claims, the consensus procedure shall apply to all claims which have not been assigned to an administrative law judge prior to July 15, 2002.  The consensus classification shall be presumed to be the correct classification of the employee's condition unless overcome by clear and convincing evidence.  If an administrative law judge finds that the presumption of correctness of the consensus reading has been overcome, the reasons shall be specially stated in the administrative law judge's order.

Kentucky Revised Statutes Title XVIII. Public Health § 224.18-200. Interstate Compact on Air Pollution,https://codes.findlaw.com/ky/title-xviii-public-health/ky-rev-st-sect-224-18-200.html,"ARTICLE IThe party states to this compact hereby provide for the control of the interstate movement of air pollutants through the establishment of an interstate agency with powers to prevent, abate, and control interstate air pollution.Each of the party states pledges to the other faithful cooperation in the control of air pollution which originates in one state and is injurious to human health or welfare, animal or plant life, or property, or which interferes with the enjoyment of life or property, in the other state.The party states recognize that no single standard for outdoor atmosphere is applicable to all areas within the two party states due to such variables as population densities, topographic and climatic characteristics, and existing or projected land use and economic development.  The guiding principle of this compact is that air pollution originating within a party state shall not be injurious to human health or welfare, animal or plant life, or property, or interfere with the enjoyment of life or property in the other party state.
ARTICLE IIAs used in this compact “air pollution” means the discharge into the air by the act of man of substances (liquid, solid, gaseous, organic or inorganic) in a locality, manner and amount as to be injurious to human health or welfare, animal or plant life, or property, or which would interfere with the enjoyment of life or property.
ARTICLE IIIThe party states hereby create the Interstate Air Pollution Control Commission, hereafter called “the commission.”The commission shall consist of five commissioners from each party state, each of whom shall be a citizen of the state he represents, and one commissioner representing the United States Government who shall be appointed by the President of the United States, or in such other manner as may be provided by the Congress.  The commissioners from each party state shall be chosen by the governor of such state in accordance with the laws of such state, as follows:Two of the members from each state shall be chosen from appropriate state agencies, one of whom is the officer responsible for air pollution control, and one of whom is the director of state health department.  Three other members shall be chosen, one of whom is experienced in the field of municipal government, one of whom is experienced in the field of industrial activities, and one of whom represents the public.Except for the commissioner representing the United States Government and commissioners who shall be appointed by virtue of the offices which they hold and who may be commissioners during their continuance in office, the term of each commissioner shall be four years.  However, the commissioner experienced in the field of municipal government, the commissioner experienced in the field of industrial activities, and the commissioner appointed to represent the public shall be appointed, one for an initial term of one year, one for an initial term of two years, and one for an initial term of three years.  As the term of each such initial appointee expires, the successor to fill the vacancy created by such expired term shall be appointed for a term of four years.Vacancies on the commission shall be filled for the unexpired term in the same manner as appointments to full terms.Each commissioner shall be entitled to one vote in the commission.  No action of the commission shall be binding unless taken at a meeting in which a majority of the commissioners from each party state are present and unless a majority of those present at the meeting from each party state concur, but any action not binding for such a reason may be ratified within thirty days by the concurrence of a majority of the commissioners of each party state.  In the absence of any commissioner, his vote may be cast by another commissioner of his state if such commissioner casting the vote shall have a written proxy in such form as may be required by the commission.The commission may sue and be sued, and shall have a seal.The commission shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman and vice chairman.  The commission shall appoint an executive director who shall act as secretary, and who, together with such other commission personnel as the commission may determine, shall be bonded in such amount or amounts as the commission may require.Notwithstanding the civil service, personnel, or other merit systems laws of any of the party states, the commission shall appoint, remove or discharge, and fix the compensation of personnel necessary for the performance of the commission's functions.  To the extent practicable, terms and conditions of employment for members of the staff of the commission shall be similar to those pertaining to comparable employees of the individual party states.The commission may establish and maintain, independently or in conjunction with one or more of the party states, a suitable retirement system for its employees.  Employees of the commission shall be eligible for social security coverage in respect to old-age and survivors insurance, if the commission takes the steps necessary pursuant to federal law to participate in such program of insurance as a governmental agency or unit.  The commission may establish and maintain or participate in additional programs of employee benefits appropriate to afford employees of the commission terms and conditions of employment similar to those enjoyed by employees of the party states generally.The commission may accept, or contract for the services of personnel and other services or materials from any state, the United States or any subdivision or agency of either, from any interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm, or corporation.The commission may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services conditional or otherwise, from the United States, or any agency thereof, from any state or any subdivision or agency thereof, or from any institution, person, firm, or corporation, and may receive, utilize, and dispose of the same.  The identity of any donor, the amount and character of any assistance, and the conditions, if any, attached thereto shall be set forth in the annual report of the commission.The commission may establish and maintain the facilities necessary for the transacting of its business.  The commission may acquire, hold, and convey real and personal property and any interest therein.The commission may formulate and adopt rules and regulations and perform any act which it finds necessary to carry out the provisions of this compact, and may amend such rules and regulations.  All such rules and regulations shall be filed in the office of the commission for public inspection and copies of such rules and regulations shall be filed in the office in each party state in which rules and regulations of state agencies are filed and shall thereafter be made available to interested persons upon request.The commission annually shall make to the governor and legislature of each party state a report covering the activities of the commission for the preceding year, and embodying recommendations adopted by the commission.  The commission may issue such additional reports as it may deem desirable.  These reports shall be available for public examination.The commission shall have the authority to collect and disseminate information relating to its functions under, and the purpose of, this compact.
ARTICLE IVThe commission, may, whenever it finds air pollution which originates in one of the party states and has an adverse effect in the other party state, make a report recommending measures for the prevention, abatement, or control of the air pollution.  Copies of the report shall be furnished to all existing state and local air pollution control agencies with jurisdiction over the sources of air pollution identified in the report.  In preparing any report, the commission may confer with any appropriate national, regional, or local planning body, and any governmental agency authorized to deal with matters relating to air pollution problems and may conduct such hearings and investigations as it may deem appropriate.  The commission may consult with and advise the states and local governments, corporations, persons, or other entities with regard to the adoption of programs and the installation of equipment and works for the prevention, abatement, or control of air pollution.  For the enforcement of this compact the commission may also establish standards consistent with the provisions of this compact and any standards which may be adopted by the party states.Before any report of the commission which specifically identifies a particular industrial or other installation, structure, or facility as a source of air pollution becomes final, the commission shall give the owner or operator of the installation, structure, or facility notice by certified mail of the anticipated adoption of such report and shall afford the owner or operator of the installation, structure, or facility not less than ten days after the mailing of such notice to file with the commission its written objections thereto.  If no such objections are filed with the commission within such specified period, the report shall become final.  If the objections are filed with the commission within the specified period, the commission shall afford the owner or operator not less than ten days from its receipt of objections to discuss with the commission the findings, conclusions, and recommendations of the report before it is finally adopted by the commission.Within a reasonable time after the commission furnishes a report to the appropriate existing state and local air pollution control agencies pursuant to this article and, if the recommendations made in such report for the prevention, abatement, or control of air pollution from a specific source or sources have not been implemented, or if the appropriate state or local air pollution control agencies have not taken sufficient action to prevent, abate, or control the air pollution, the commission may, after a duly conducted and constituted hearing, on due notice, issue an order upon any municipality, corporation, person, or other entity causing or contributing to interstate air pollution.  At any such hearing evidence may be received and a finding made on whether, in fact, interstate air pollution exists and on the sources of such pollution.  Any order may prescribe a timetable for the abatement of control of the air pollution involved.  Any such order shall become final and binding unless a petition for review of the same shall be filed and prosecuted pursuant to the provisions of Article V of this compact.In a party state, any court of general jurisdiction in any county in which the air pollution originates or any United States district court for the district in which the pollution originates shall entertain and determine any action or proceeding brought by the commission to enforce an order against any municipality, corporation, person, or other entity domiciled or located within such state and whose discharge of air pollution takes place within or adjoining such state, or against any employee, department, or subdivision of such municipality, corporation, person or other entity, and shall entertain and determine any petition for review pursuant to the provisions of Article V of this compact.
ARTICLE VAll hearings held by the commission shall be open to the public.  At any hearing held pursuant to Article IV of this compact the party states, any agencies thereof, and any affected person, corporation, municipality, or other entity shall be entitled to appear in person or by representative, with or without counsel, and may make oral or written argument, offer testimony, or take any combination of such actions.  All testimony taken before the commission shall be under oath and recorded in a written transcript.  The transcript so recorded shall be made available to any member of the public or to any participant in such hearing upon payment of reasonable charges as fixed by the commission.  No information relating to secret processes or methods of manufacture or production shall be disclosed at any public hearing or otherwise and all such information shall be kept confidential.All hearings shall be had before one or more members of the commission, or before an officer or employee of the commission expressly designated to act as a hearing officer.Any party state or person aggrieved by any order made by the commission shall be entitled to a judicial review thereof.  Such review may be had by filing a verified petition in any of the appropriate courts referred to in Article IV, setting out such order and alleging specifically that said order is:
(a) Arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;  or

(b) Contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity;  or

(c) In excess of authority or jurisdiction conferred by this compact or statutes in implementation hereof;  or

(d) Without observance of procedure required by law;  or

(f) Unsupported by the weight of the evidence.
The petition for a review shall be filed within thirty-five days after receipt of written notice that the order has been issued.  Written notice of the filing of a petition for review and a copy of said petition shall be personally served upon the commission.  Any party or person filing a petition for review shall, within fifteen days thereafter, secure from the commission a certified copy of the transcript of any hearing held in connection with the issuance of the order, review of which is sought, and shall file the same with the clerk of the court in which the action or proceeding for review is pending.  An extension of time in which to file a transcript shall be granted by said court in which such action or proceeding for review is pending for good cause shown.  Inability to obtain a transcript within the specified time shall be good cause.  Failure to file a transcript within the period of fifteen days, or to secure an extension of time therefor, shall be cause for the dismissal of the petition for review by the court or on petition of any party of record to the original action or proceeding.  Where more than one person may be aggrieved by the order, only one proceeding for review may be had and the court in which a petition for review is first properly filed shall have jurisdiction.
The court may, for good cause shown, admit and consider additional evidence bearing upon the issue or issues before it.
No review of a commission order shall be had except in accordance with the provisions of this compact.
