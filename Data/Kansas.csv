The county clerk, not less than 15 days before the hearing, shall send notices of the hearing with a copy of the petition, without the signatures, to the clerk, secretary or chairperson of any duly constituted city, county, regional or metropolitan planning commission exercising planning authority over all or part of the territory, to the director of the division of community development of the department of economic development and to the city clerk of any city, any portion of which is within five miles of the nearest boundary of the territory as described in the petition.


(b) As a guide in determining the advisability of organizing the district, the board shall consider the following factors, among others: (1) Population and population density of the area within the boundaries of the territory;  (2) land area, topography, natural boundaries and drainage basin;  (3) area of platted land relative to unplatted land and assessed value of platted land relative to assessed value of unplatted areas;  (4) extent of residential, business, commercial and industrial development;  (5) past expansion in terms of population and construction;  (6) likelihood of significant growth in the area, and in adjacent areas, during the next 10 years;  (7) the present cost and adequacy of governmental services and controls in the area and the probable effect of the proposed action, and of alternative courses of action, on the cost and adequacy of local governmental services and regulation in the area and in adjacent areas;  (8) the need for the public improvements in the proposed district and whether the issuance of bonds therefor would unduly require the speculative use of public funds;  and (9) effect of the proposed action, and of alternative actions, on adjacent areas and on the local governmental structure of the general area.


(c) If the territory or any part thereof is within five miles of an existing city, the board shall take into consideration: (1) The size and population of such city;  (2) the city's growth in population, business and industry during the past 10 years;  (3) the extension of its boundaries during the past 10 years;  (4) the probability of its growth toward the territory during the ensuing 10 years, taking into consideration natural barriers and other reasons which might influence growth toward the territory;  (5) the willingness of the city to annex the territory and its ability to provide city services in case of annexation;  and (6) the general effect upon the entire community, all of these and other considerations having to do with the overall orderly and economic development of the area and to prevent an unreasonable multiplicity of independent municipal and special district governments.

(c) Prior to August 1, 1987, and each August 1 thereafter, except as provided in subsections (b) and (d), of the total amount of moneys credited to the state firefighters relief fund as of July 1 of the same year the amounts determined as prescribed in subsections (c)(1) through (c)(6) shall be paid as provided therein.

, and amendments thereto, for all of calendar year 1983, bears to the total amount paid to all firefighters relief associations from the taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983, subject to adjustments made to correct for errors in the payments distributed and as otherwise provided pursuant to this subsection (c)(4), adjustments made pursuant to subsection (c)(5) for firefighters relief associations that did not receive a payment from taxes paid for all of calendar year 1983 and adjustments pursuant to subsection (c)(6) for redeterminations based upon changed circumstances. The commissioner of insurance may make adjustments in the amounts of payments for the current year made under this subsection (c)(4) for errors in the payments distributed for the prior year, except that adjustments may be made in the payments to be distributed by August 1, 1987, for any errors in the payments distributed during the period from July 1, 1984, through June 30, 1987, and an adjustment shall be made in the payment to be distributed by August 1, 1987, for each firefighters relief association which was in existence for only part of calendar year 1983 and which received a payment for calendar year 1983 based on the taxes received for only part of calendar year 1983, to reflect the total of the payments that would most probably have been received by such firefighters relief association during the period from August 1, 1984, through June 30, 1987, if such firefighters relief association had been in existence for all of calendar year 1983, reduced by the payments actually received by such firefighters relief association during the period from August 1, 1984, through June 30, 1987. For purposes of all payments under subsection (c)(4) after the adjusted payment distributed by August 1, 1987, such firefighters relief association shall be considered to have received for calendar year 1983, the amount it most probably would have received if it had been in existence for all of calendar year 1983, which shall be the amount having the same proportional relationship to 365 days as the amount actually received for calendar year 1983 has to the number of days that such firefighters relief association was in existence during calendar year 1983, subject to adjustments pursuant to subsection (c)(6) for redeterminations based upon changed circumstances.


(5) Whenever a firefighters relief association is to receive a payment under subsection (c)(4) but did not receive a payment from any of the taxes collected for calendar year 1983, the commissioner of insurance shall determine for the nonreceiving association, from such information as is made available to the commissioner by the nonreceiving association, the amount the nonreceiving association would most probably have received if it had actually received such a payment from the taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983, with appropriate adjustments based on payments to firefighters relief associations of fire departments providing fire protection services within geographic areas having similar populations and assessed tangible property valuation as the geographic area provided fire protection services by the fire department of each such nonreceiving association. The commissioner shall make such determination as follows:

(A) One-half of the amount due shall be determined based upon the population figure provided by the association pursuant to administrative rules and regulations adopted by the commissioner. The determination of this  1/2 of the amount due shall be made in accordance with the following formula:

(i) An association which received a payment from the taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 and which has a population similar to that of the nonreceiving association shall be ascertained;


(ii) the payment the comparable association received from taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 shall be divided by two;


(iii) the population of the area served by the nonreceiving association shall be divided by the population of the area served by the association to which the nonreceiving association is being compared, to produce an adjustment factor reflecting the variance in population size;  and


(iv) the amount received from taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 by the association with the comparable population shall be multiplied by the population adjustment factor obtained in paragraph (iii) of this subsection (c)(5)(A).



(B) The remaining  1/2 of the amount due shall be determined based upon the assessed tangible property valuation figure provided by the nonreceiving association pursuant to administrative rules and regulations adopted by the commissioner. The determination of the remaining  1/2 of the amount due shall be made in accordance with the following formula:

(i) An association which received a payment from the taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 and which has an assessed tangible property valuation as of November 1, 1989, similar to that of the nonreceiving association shall be ascertained;


(ii) the payment the comparable association received from taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 shall be divided by two;


(iii) the assessed tangible property valuation of the area served by the nonreceiving association shall be divided by the assessed tangible property valuation of the area served by the association to which the nonreceiving association is being compared, to produce an adjustment factor reflecting the variance in assessed tangible property valuation;  and


(iv) the amount received from taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 by the association with the comparable assessed tangible property valuation shall be multiplied by the valuation adjustment factor obtained in paragraph (iii) of this subsection (c)(5)(B).



(C) The amount obtained in paragraph (iv) of subsection (c)(5)(A) shall be added to the amount obtained in paragraph (iv) of subsection (c)(5)(B) to determine the total amount the nonreceiving association most probably would have received if it had actually received a payment from the taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983. The amount a nonreceiving association most probably would have received if it had actually received a payment from taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 shall be divided by the total amount paid to all firefighters relief associations from the taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 to determine the proportionate amount due the nonreceiving association for the current and succeeding years and thereafter such association shall not be considered to be a nonreceiving association. The commissioner of insurance shall include the amount so determined within the computations prescribed by subsection (c)(4) for payments thereunder.



(6) One or more firefighters relief associations may apply, prior to October 1 of any year, to the commissioner of insurance for a redetermination of the proportionate amounts payable to all firefighters relief associations under subsection (c)(4) and, upon receipt of such application, the commissioner of insurance shall hold one joint hearing in accordance with the provisions of the Kansas administrative procedure act prior to December 1 of such year, at which all applicants shall be heard and may present information. The commissioner of insurance may redetermine such proportionate amounts based upon such information as is presented to or otherwise made available by the applicants to the commissioner and may make a finding of changed circumstances. However, increases in the assessed tangible property valuation resulting from a statewide reappraisal conducted pursuant to 
K.S.A. 79-1476 et seq.
, and amendments thereto, shall not constitute a changed circumstance. Upon making such finding, the commissioner of insurance may include such redetermination within the computations prescribed by subsection (c)(4) for payments in subsequent years. Any increase or reduction in the amounts to be distributed as a result of a finding of changed circumstances by the commissioner shall be proportionately distributed among all firefighters relief associations. An application for redetermination shall not be made by any firefighters relief association more often than once every three years, but this restriction shall not apply with respect to applications for redetermination submitted in calendar year 1989 that were based in whole or in part on an increase in the assessed tangible property valuation resulting from statewide reappraisal.



(1) An amount equal to 3% of such total amount shall be paid by the commissioner of insurance to the treasurer of the Kansas state firefighters association, inc. for fire prevention and fire extinguishment education and study.


(2) An amount equal to 5% of such total amount shall be paid by the commissioner of insurance to the Kansas state firefighters association, inc. which shall be set aside as a death benefit fund to provide such benefits as determined by the association in accordance with the constitution and bylaws thereof, except the amount paid under this subsection (c)(2) shall not be more than the lesser of $100,000 or the result obtained by subtracting the balance in the death benefit fund of the association on July 1 from $100,000.


(3) The amount of $1,000 shall be paid by the commissioner of insurance to each firefighters relief association.


(4) The remaining amount of the moneys credited to the state firefighters relief fund, after the amounts are reserved or paid for the purposes authorized by subsections (b)(2), (c)(1), (c)(2) and (c)(3), shall be paid by the commissioner of insurance to firefighters relief associations so that the amount received by each firefighters relief association bears the same proportion to the total amount to be paid as the amount such firefighters relief association received from the amounts collected from the tax imposed by 
K.S.A. 40-1703
, and amendments thereto, for all of calendar year 1983, bears to the total amount paid to all firefighters relief associations from the taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983, subject to adjustments made to correct for errors in the payments distributed and as otherwise provided pursuant to this subsection (c)(4), adjustments made pursuant to subsection (c)(5) for firefighters relief associations that did not receive a payment from taxes paid for all of calendar year 1983 and adjustments pursuant to subsection (c)(6) for redeterminations based upon changed circumstances. The commissioner of insurance may make adjustments in the amounts of payments for the current year made under this subsection (c)(4) for errors in the payments distributed for the prior year, except that adjustments may be made in the payments to be distributed by August 1, 1987, for any errors in the payments distributed during the period from July 1, 1984, through June 30, 1987, and an adjustment shall be made in the payment to be distributed by August 1, 1987, for each firefighters relief association which was in existence for only part of calendar year 1983 and which received a payment for calendar year 1983 based on the taxes received for only part of calendar year 1983, to reflect the total of the payments that would most probably have been received by such firefighters relief association during the period from August 1, 1984, through June 30, 1987, if such firefighters relief association had been in existence for all of calendar year 1983, reduced by the payments actually received by such firefighters relief association during the period from August 1, 1984, through June 30, 1987. For purposes of all payments under subsection (c)(4) after the adjusted payment distributed by August 1, 1987, such firefighters relief association shall be considered to have received for calendar year 1983, the amount it most probably would have received if it had been in existence for all of calendar year 1983, which shall be the amount having the same proportional relationship to 365 days as the amount actually received for calendar year 1983 has to the number of days that such firefighters relief association was in existence during calendar year 1983, subject to adjustments pursuant to subsection (c)(6) for redeterminations based upon changed circumstances.


(5) Whenever a firefighters relief association is to receive a payment under subsection (c)(4) but did not receive a payment from any of the taxes collected for calendar year 1983, the commissioner of insurance shall determine for the nonreceiving association, from such information as is made available to the commissioner by the nonreceiving association, the amount the nonreceiving association would most probably have received if it had actually received such a payment from the taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983, with appropriate adjustments based on payments to firefighters relief associations of fire departments providing fire protection services within geographic areas having similar populations and assessed tangible property valuation as the geographic area provided fire protection services by the fire department of each such nonreceiving association. The commissioner shall make such determination as follows:

(ii) the payment the comparable association received from taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 shall be divided by two;


(iii) the population of the area served by the nonreceiving association shall be divided by the population of the area served by the association to which the nonreceiving association is being compared, to produce an adjustment factor reflecting the variance in population size;  and


(iv) the amount received from taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 by the association with the comparable population shall be multiplied by the population adjustment factor obtained in paragraph (iii) of this subsection (c)(5)(A).



(B) The remaining  1/2 of the amount due shall be determined based upon the assessed tangible property valuation figure provided by the nonreceiving association pursuant to administrative rules and regulations adopted by the commissioner.

(iv) the amount received from taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 by the association with the comparable assessed tangible property valuation shall be multiplied by the valuation adjustment factor obtained in paragraph (iii) of this subsection (c)(5)(B).



(C) The amount obtained in paragraph (iv) of subsection (c)(5)(A) shall be added to the amount obtained in paragraph (iv) of subsection (c)(5)(B) to determine the total amount the nonreceiving association most probably would have received if it had actually received a payment from the taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983. The amount a nonreceiving association most probably would have received if it had actually received a payment from taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 shall be divided by the total amount paid to all firefighters relief associations from the taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 to determine the proportionate amount due the nonreceiving association for the current and succeeding years and thereafter such association shall not be considered to be a nonreceiving association. The commissioner of insurance shall include the amount so determined within the computations prescribed by subsection (c)(4) for payments thereunder.



(A) One-half of the amount due shall be determined based upon the population figure provided by the association pursuant to administrative rules and regulations adopted by the commissioner. The determination of this  1/2 of the amount due shall be made in accordance with the following formula:

(i) An association which received a payment from the taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 and which has a population similar to that of the nonreceiving association shall be ascertained;


(ii) the payment the comparable association received from taxes collected for all of calendar year 1983 shall be divided by two;


(iii) the population of the area served by the nonreceiving association shall be divided by the population of the area served by the association to which the nonreceiving association is being compared, to produce an adjustment factor reflecting the variance in population size;  and

(a) When the governing body deems it necessary to grade, regrade or improve any street, lane, avenue or alley, or any part thereof, within the limits of the city, for which a special tax is to be levied, such governing body shall by resolution declare the work or improvement necessary to be done. Such resolution shall be published once in the official paper of the city. If the resident owners of more than  1/2 the property liable for taxation therefor do not, within 20 days from the mailing of notice pursuant to subsection (f), file with the clerk of the city their protest against the work or improvement, the governing body shall have power to cause such work to be done or such improvement to be made and to contract therefor and to levy taxes as provided by law. The work may be done before, during or after the collection of the special assessment.


(b) No provision of this act shall prevent the governing body from grading or regrading any street, lane or alley or part thereof, and pay therefor out of the general improvement fund of such city.


(c) In all cities of the first class having a population of less than 30,000, the governing body, when it deems it necessary to be done, and for the general welfare of such city, may by resolution, regardless of any protest, order the whole or any part of any street which extends from any other paved or macadamized street to any depot or cemetery in or adjoining such city, or any street which extends from the main business street or from the main business center of such city to any depot or cemetery within or adjoining such city, or any street, not to exceed four in number, which extends from the principal business center of such city to and is connected with any main public highway leading to or from such city to be improved and shall have power to cause the improvements to be made, to contract for the making of the same and to levy taxes to pay the expenses of such improvements.


(d) The city at large shall pay the expenses of grading or regrading such street or streets and all expenses of the areas and intersections formed by the crossing of streets and alleys and all crossings of streets and alleys and  1/3 of the expenses of improving each block of such street or streets between cross streets and of improving along each lot or piece of unplatted land adjoining such street or streets. Two-thirds of the expense of improving any block in such street between the cross streets, or any such street along an unplatted lot or piece of land in such city, adjoining or abutting on such street, shall be assessed to the adjoining property by special assessment, and except as to the amount assessed against such adjoining property, the adjoining property shall be appraised and assessed to the extent and in the manner provided by law for paying the expenses of improving streets and alleys in cities of the first class when protest may be made. Such cities are authorized to issue improvement bonds in the manner provided by law to pay the expenses of the improvement. In estimating the expenses of improvements for which the city or adjoining property will be liable, the city shall deduct from the aggregate expense of such improvements the amount or proportion of the expense for the payment of which any street railway company or other railway company will be liable. No street railway company or other railway company shall be relieved by reason of this act from any tax or assessment for which it is now liable under any statute for any street improvement.


(e) In cities of the first class having a population of over 30,000, no resolution to pave, macadamize, grade, repave, remacadamize or regrade any street, lane or alley shall be valid unless a petition requesting such improvement has been filed with the city clerk, which petition must be signed by the resident owners of not less than  1/2 the feet fronting or abutting upon the street, lane or alley to be improved. The feet fronting or abutting upon such street, lane or alley owned or held by persons who are not residents of the city shall not be taken into account in determining the sufficiency of any such protest or any such petition. In case of paving, such petition shall state the width of the paving and the kind of material to be used but shall not include the naming of the brand of material or the name of the manufacturer thereof.


(f) Whenever any governing body has proceeded under this section to grade, regrade or improve any street, lane, avenue or alley, or any part thereof, the governing body shall ascertain before the contract is let therefor the approximate cost of such improvement to the separate tracts and pieces of land liable therefor. The city clerk shall thereupon send by certified mail to the owners of such land, at the address where the owner's tax statement is sent, a written notice of the approximate amount which will be assessed against such land. The governing body shall, within 30 days from the date of mailing such notices, determine whether the approximate cost of such improvement is unreasonable in comparison with the value of the tracts and pieces of land liable therefor. If the cost is found to be unreasonable, the governing body shall cancel the proceedings theretofore taken for such improvements. The failure of the owner to receive such notice or the inaccuracy of the amount of the approximate costs shall not affect the validity of the proceedings.


(g) As used in this section, “improve” means curb, gutter, pave, macadamize, recurb, regutter, repave or remacadamize.

The provisions of this subsection may be varied through interlocal agreements.


(b) The planning commission may adopt and amend a comprehensive plan as a whole by a single resolution, or by successive resolutions, the planning commission may adopt or amend parts of the plan. Such resolution shall identify specifically any written presentations, maps, plats, charts or other materials made a part of such plan. In the preparation of such plan, the planning commission shall make or cause to be made comprehensive surveys and studies of past and present conditions and trends relating to land use, population and building intensity, public facilities, transportation and transportation facilities, economic conditions, natural resources and may include any other element deemed necessary to the comprehensive plan.

Before adopting or amending any such plan or part thereof, the planning commission shall hold a public hearing thereon, notice of which shall be published at least once in the official city newspaper in the case of a city or in the official county newspaper in the case of a county. Such notice shall be published at least 20 days prior to the date of the hearing. Upon the adoption or amendment of any such plan or part thereof by adoption of the appropriate resolution by a majority vote of all members of the planning commission, a certified copy of the plan or part thereof, together with a written summary of the hearing thereon, shall be submitted to the governing body.

Upon the receipt of such recommendations, the governing body, by a simple majority thereof, may adopt or may revise or amend and adopt such recommendations by the respective ordinance or resolution, or it need take no further action thereon. If the planning commission fails to deliver its recommendations to the governing body following the planning commission's next regular meeting after receipt of the governing body's report, the governing body shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the planning commission as a resubmission of the original recommendations and proceed accordingly. The comprehensive plan and any amendments thereto shall become effective upon publication of the respective adopting ordinance or resolution.

(d) At least once each year, the planning commission shall review or reconsider the plan or any part thereof and may propose amendments, extensions or additions to the same. The procedure for the adoption of any such amendment, extension or addition to any plan or part thereof shall be the same as that required for the adoption of the original plan or part thereof.

(a) The board of county commissioners, by resolution, may provide for the adoption or amendment of zoning regulations for the unincorporated portion of the county in the manner, and for the purposes, provided by this act.  Such regulations may (1) restrict and regulate the height, number of stories and size of buildings;  (2) the percentage of lots that may be occupied;  (3) the size of yards, courts and other open spaces;  (4) the density of population, including minimum width, depth and area of lots;  (5) the location and use of buildings, structures and land for industry, business, trade or residence;  and (6) the use of land located in areas designated as floodplains.  Such resolution shall define the boundaries of zoning classifications by description contained therein or by setting out such boundaries upon a map incorporated and published as a part of such resolution, or by providing for the incorporation by reference in such resolution of an official map upon which such boundaries shall be fixed.  Such map shall be marked “official copy incorporated by resolution of the board of county commissioners the _____ day of __________, 19___,” and filed in a public office designated by the board of county commissioners and shall be a public record.


(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), before the board of county commissioners creates any zone, district or zoning classification or regulates or restricts the use of buildings or land in the unincorporated portion of the county, the board shall require the planning commission to recommend to the board of county commissioners the nature and number of zoning classifications which the planning commission deems necessary, the boundaries of the same and appropriate regulations or restrictions to be enforced therein.  All such regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of buildings or land uses throughout each zoning classification, but the regulations in one zoning classification may differ from those in other zoning classifications, and the regulations may prescribe conditions under which conditional use permits may be issued providing exceptions to such uniform regulations.  The issuance of any conditional use permit shall be considered a change or revision to the zoning map and shall be subject to the same notice, hearing and voting requirements prescribed herein for rezonings.  The regulations shall be made in accordance with a land use plan and, in addition to the purposes provided in 
K.S.A. 19-2956
, shall be designed to:  (1) Lessen congestion in each district;  (2) provide adequate light and air;  (3) prevent the overcrowding of land;  (4) avoid undue concentrations of population;  and (5) to facilitate the adequate provisions of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements.  Such regulations shall be made with reasonable consideration, among other things, to existing conditions, to the character of the district, its peculiar suitability for particular uses and with a view to conserving the values of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land within the county.
The notice, hearing and voting procedures for adoption of the zoning regulations shall be the same as that required for adoption of the comprehensive plan as provided by 
K.S.A. 19-2958
.
After adoption of the zoning resolution, the zoning regulations, the zoning classifications or the boundaries contained therein may from time to time be supplemented, changed or generally revised by amendment.  The boundaries on the zoning map may from time to time be changed or revised by a rezoning or conditional use permit.  A proposal for an amendment, rezoning or conditional use permit may be initiated by the board of county commissioners, the planning commission, any zoning board or upon application of the owner of property affected.
The board of county commissioners may establish reasonable fees to be paid in advance by the owner of any property at the time of making application for any amendment, rezoning or conditional use permit.
All such proposed amendments, rezonings or conditional use permits first shall be submitted to either the planning commission for recommendation regarding amendments or the appropriate zoning board for recommendation regarding rezonings or conditional use permits.  All notice, hearing and voting procedures for consideration of proposed amendments, rezonings and conditional use permits shall be the same as that required for amendments, extensions or additions to the comprehensive plan as provided by 
K.S.A. 19-2958
.  Rezonings and conditional use permits shall be designated by legal description and general street location and, in addition to publication notice, written notice of such proposed rezoning or conditional use permit shall be mailed to all owners of record of lands located within 1,000 feet of the property affected by such rezoning or conditional use permit and an opportunity granted to interested parties to be heard, all as provided in the zoning regulations.  Failure to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken.
On hearings concerning rezonings and conditional use permits, such notice is sufficient to permit the zoning board to make a recommendation which affects only a portion of the land described in the notice or which gives all or any part of the land described a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth in the notice.  Recommending a zoning classification of lesser change than that set forth in the notice shall not be valid without republication, remailing and a new public hearing unless the planning commission shall have previously established, with the approval of the board of county commissioners, a table or publication available to the public which designates what zoning classifications are lesser changes authorized within the adopted zoning resolution.
If such amendment, rezoning or conditional use permit affects the boundaries of any zoning classification, the resolution of the board of county commissioners shall describe the boundaries, as amended, or if the county has made provision for the fixing of the same upon an official map which has been incorporated by reference, the amending resolution shall define the change or the boundary, as amended, shall order the official map to be changed to reflect such amendment and shall reincorporate such map as amended.
Regardless whether a zoning board recommends to approve or disapprove a proposed rezoning or conditional use permit or “fails to recommend” if a protest against such rezoning or conditional use permit is filed in the office of the county clerk within 14 days after the date of the conclusion of the public hearing held pursuant to such publication notice, duly signed and acknowledged by the owners of 20% or more of any real property subject to the rezoning or conditional use permit or by the owners of 20% of the total area, except public streets and ways, located within 1,000 feet of the boundaries of the property subject to the rezoning or conditional use permit, the resolution adopting such rezoning or conditional use permit shall not be passed except by a favorable vote of at least  4/5 of all of the members of the board of county commissioners.


(c) A resolution adopting rezoning or a conditional use permit for mining operations subject to 
K.S.A. 49-601 et seq.
, and amendments thereto, regardless of a protest petition or a failure to recommend by the planning commission, shall only require approval by a majority of all members of the board of county commissioners.


(d) Regulations adopted under authority of this act shall not apply to the existing use of any buildings or land and shall not prevent the restoration of a building damaged not more than 50% of its assessed valuation by fire, explosion, act of God, or the public enemy, or prevent the continuance of the use of such building or part thereof as such use existed at the time of such damage, but shall apply to any alteration, expansion or enlargement of a building or alteration of any land after the effective date of any such zoning resolution.  No determination nor rule nor regulation shall be held to apply to the use of land for agricultural purposes, nor for the erection or maintenance of buildings thereon for such purposes so long as such land and buildings erected thereon are used for agricultural purposes and not otherwise.
No zoning regulations shall apply to the use of land for agricultural purposes nor for the erection or maintenance of agricultural buildings as long as such agricultural buildings are used for agricultural purposes and no other.  Dwellings, garages and other similar accessory buildings shall not be considered as agricultural buildings.  All buildings, including agricultural buildings, may be regulated as to setback requirements from public roads so as to protect the future use and improvement of such roads.


(e) Whenever the board of county commissioners has adopted, as a part of the comprehensive plan, a plan for its present or future street or highway system and such plan outlines the intentions of the county for improvements to existing streets or highways, for constructing new streets or highways or for establishing right-of-way needs for streets or highways, the board of county commissioners is hereby authorized, by resolution, to establish, further regulate and limit, and to change and amend, additional building or setback lines on such present or future streets or highways.  The board of county commissioners is also authorized to prohibit any new building being located within such building or setback line outside the corporate limits of any city.  The resolution may be adopted, and amended or changed, as a part of the zoning regulations.

(a) The planning commission, with the approval of the board of county commissioners, may make or cause to be made a comprehensive plan for coordinated development of the county in the manner, and for the purposes, provided by this act. In the preparation of such plan, the planning commission shall make or cause to be made comprehensive surveys and studies of past and present conditions and trends relating to land use, population and building intensity, public facilities, transportation and transportation facilities, economic conditions, natural resources, and may include any other element deemed necessary to the comprehensive plan. Such proposed plan, which in addition to a written presentation, may include maps, plats, charts and other descriptive matter, shall show the commission's recommendations for the development or redevelopment of the county and may include: (1) The general location, extent and relationship of the use of land for agriculture, residence, business, industry, recreation, education, public buildings and other community facilities, major utility facilities both public and private and any other use deemed necessary;  (2) population and building intensity standards and restrictions and the application of the same;  (3) public facilities including transportation facilities of all types, whether publicly or privately owned, which relate to the transportation of persons or goods;  (4) public improvement programming based upon a determination of relative urgency;  (5) the major sources and expenditure of public revenue including long range financial plans for the financing of public facilities and capital improvements, based upon a projection of the economic and fiscal activity of the county, both public and private;  (6) utilization and conservation of natural resources;  and (7) any other element deemed necessary for the proper development or redevelopment of the area.


(b) The planning commission, by an affirmative vote of a majority of all its members, may approve for recommendation the comprehensive plan as a whole by a single resolution, or may by successive resolutions approve parts of the plan, such parts corresponding with the major geographical sections of the county or with functional subdivisions of the plan. Such resolution shall specifically identify any maps, plats, charts or other materials made a part of such plan. Before the approval for recommendation of any such plan or part thereof, the planning commission shall hold a public hearing thereon, notice of which shall be published once in the official county newspaper at least 20 days prior to the date fixed for hearing. Such hearing may be adjourned from time to time. Upon the approval for recommendation of any such plan or part thereof, a certified copy of the same shall be submitted to the board of county commissioners for its consideration and final approval. Upon request, copies of the proposed plan or part thereof, together with notice of the time and place when the board of county commissioners will consider adoption of the plan or part thereof, shall be provided to other interested legislative or administrative agencies for review and comment. Failure to receive such copies or other notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken on the plan or part thereof.


(c) The board of county commissioners shall consider such proposed comprehensive plan or part thereof as recommended by the planning commission. If the board of county commissioners approves such recommendation, it may adopt, by resolution, such proposed plan or part thereof. If the board of county commissioners disapproves, in whole or in part, the planning commission's recommendation, the board of county commissioners shall return such recommendation or part thereof to the planning commission for further consideration along with a written statement of reasons for disapproving the same or with suggested modifications. If the board of county commissioners returns the plan or part thereof as originally recommended to the planning commission for further consideration as disapproved or with suggested modifications, the planning commission shall reconsider such plan or part thereof as returned and, within 30 days of receipt thereof or such lesser or greater time period as determined by the board of county commissioners, either submit a new recommendation to the board of county commissioners or resubmit its original recommendation to the board of county commissioners. No additional public hearing shall be required unless the board of county commissioners directs that one be held. If the planning commission fails to deliver its recommendation to the board of county commissioners within such time period, the board of county commissioners shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the planning commission as a resubmission of its original recommendation. The board of county commissioners, after receipt of the new or original recommendation of the planning commission on the returned plan or part thereof, shall reconsider such matter and thereafter, by resolution, may adopt, in whole or in part, or may revise or amend and adopt such proposed plan or part thereof as the official plan of the county, or may take no further action thereon, as it deems appropriate.


(d) All reports and documents forming the comprehensive plan or parts thereof as adopted shall bear the signature, or facsimile thereof, of the chairperson of the board of county commissioners and an attested copy of the same shall be filed in such public office as may be designated by the board of county commissioners and shall be a public record. In addition, copies shall be provided to legislative and administrative agencies affected by the plan. Failure to receive such copy shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken. Such plan or part thereof shall constitute the basis or guide for public action to insure a coordinated and harmonious development or redevelopment which will best promote the health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity and general welfare, as well as a wise and efficient expenditure of public funds.


(e) After adoption of a comprehensive plan or part thereof by the board of county commissioners, the planning commission annually shall review the plan for the purpose of determining if any portion of the plan has become obsolete and shall make a report to the board of county commissioners regarding the same on or before June 1 of each year. In addition, the planning commission or the board of county commissioners, at any time after the adoption of the plan or part thereof, may review or reconsider such plan or part thereof so adopted and may propose, by resolution, any amendments, extensions or additions to the same.


(f) When an amendment, extension or addition to the plan or part thereof has been proposed, whether as a result of the annual review or by resolution of the board of county commissioners or the planning commission, such proposed amendment, extension or addition shall first be submitted to the planning commission for recommendation. A public hearing shall be held thereon and an accurate written summary made of the proceedings. Notice of such public hearing shall be published in like manner as that required for the original recommendation on the plan, shall fix the time and place for such hearing and shall contain a statement describing, in general terms, the proposed amendment, extension or addition to the plan.


(g) A quorum of the planning commission is more than  1/2 of all its members. For action on amendments, a vote either for or against an amendment by a majority of the members of the commission present constitutes a recommendation of approval or disapproval of the commission, whereas a vote either for or against an amendment by less than a majority of the members of the commission present constitutes a “failure to recommend.”


(h) The board of county commissioners shall consider such amendment, extension or addition as recommended by the planning commission and, regardless of whether the recommendation is for approval or disapproval, if the board of county commissioners approves such recommendation, it may adopt such recommendation, in whole or in part, by resolution, or may take no further action thereon, as it deems appropriate. In the event the planning commission submits a “failure to recommend” to the board of county commissioners, the board of county commissioners may take such action it deems appropriate. Upon a recommendation of the planning commission which the board of county commissioners, in whole or in part, disapproves, the board of county commissioners shall return such recommendation or part thereof to the planning commission for further consideration along with a written statement of reasons for disapproving the same or with suggested modifications. If the board of county commissioners returns the proposed amendment, extension or addition or part thereof to the planning commission for further consideration as disapproved or with suggested modifications, the planning commission shall reconsider such amendment, extension or addition or part thereof as returned and, within 30 days of receipt thereof or such lesser or greater time period as determined by the board of county commissioners, either submit a new recommendation to the board of county commissioners or resubmit its original recommendation to the board of county commissioners. No additional public hearing shall be required unless the board of county commissioners directs that one be held. If the planning commission fails to deliver its recommendation to the board of county commissioners within such time period the board of county commissioners shall consider such course of inaction on the part of the planning commission as a resubmission of its original recommendation. The board of county commissioners, after receipt of the new or original recommendation of the planning commission on the returned amendment, extension or addition or part thereof, shall reconsider such matter and thereafter, by resolution, may adopt, in whole or in part, or may revise or amend and adopt such amendment, extension or addition, or may take no further action thereon, as it deems appropriate. If the board of county commissioners initiated such proposed amendment, extension or addition, the board of county commissioners need not return the same to the planning commission if it disapproves of the planning commission's recommendation but may take such action as it deems appropriate after receiving the planning commission's recommendation on the amendment, extension or addition.

(a) If the governor finds that two or more adjoining counties would be served better by an interjurisdictional disaster agency than by maintaining separate disaster agencies and services, the governor shall order the establishment of an interjurisdictional disaster agency which is adequate to plan for, prevent or respond to disasters in that area and direct steps to be taken as necessary, including the creation of an interjurisdictional relationship and an interjurisdictional disaster emergency plan which provide for mutual aid or an area organization for emergency management. A copy of such order shall be given to the chairperson of the board of county commissioners of each county affected by such order and to the mayor or other principal executive officer of each city located within any such county, and such counties and cities shall act in accordance with such order. Any interjurisdictional agreement entered into by two or more counties which are ordered to establish an interjurisdictional disaster agency under this subsection, may designate a local council of defense, which was established in accordance with 
K.S.A. 48-909
, and amendments thereto, for one of such counties and which was in existence on the day immediately preceding the effective date of this act, as such interjurisdictional disaster agency. Each interjurisdictional disaster agency shall cooperate with the disaster agency of any city located within any county under the jurisdiction of such interjurisdictional disaster agency, but shall not have jurisdiction within such cities having disaster agencies. A finding by the governor pursuant to this subsection shall be based on one or more factors related to the difficulty of maintaining an efficient and effective emergency management system on a single-jurisdiction basis, such as:

(1) Small or sparse population;


(2) limitations on public financial resources severe enough to make maintenance of a separate disaster agency and services unreasonably burdensome;


(3) unusual vulnerability to disaster as evidenced by a past history of disasters, topographical features, drainage characteristics, disaster potential and presence of disaster-prone facilities or operations;


(4) the interrelated character of the counties in a multi-county area;  or


(5) other relevant conditions or circumstances.

(b) Two or more counties, which are not under the jurisdiction of an interjurisdictional disaster agency pursuant to subsection (a), may be required by the governor, by an order issued in the manner prescribed in subsection (a), to participate and enter into an interjurisdictional agreement or arrangement without requiring the establishment and maintenance of such a disaster agency therefor, if the governor finds that:

(1) Such counties, or the cities situated therein, have equipment, supplies and forces which are necessary to provide mutual aid on a regional basis;  and


(2) such counties have not made adequate provisions in their disaster emergency plans for the rendering and receipt of mutual aid for the emergency management needs of the entire region.

(2) such counties have not made adequate provisions in their disaster emergency plans for the rendering and receipt of mutual aid for the emergency management needs of the entire region.


(c) If the governor finds that it would be desirable to establish an interstate mutual aid organization or an area organization for disaster for an area including territory in this state and any other state or states, the governor shall take such action as is necessary to achieve such objective. If this state has enacted the interstate civil defense and disaster compact and this action is taken with a jurisdiction which has also enacted the interstate civil defense and disaster compact, any resulting agreement with such jurisdiction may be considered a supplemental agreement pursuant to article VI of that compact.


(d) If this state, or any other jurisdiction with which the governor proposes to cooperate pursuant to subsection (c), has not enacted the interstate civil defense and disaster compact, the governor may negotiate a special agreement with such jurisdiction. Any such agreement, if sufficient authority for the making thereof does not otherwise exist, may become effective only if its text has been submitted to the legislature by filing a copy thereof with the legislative coordinating council, and neither house of the legislature has disapproved it by resolution during the next regular session of the legislature after such submission.

Kansas Statutes Chapter 72. Schools §01 72-60a01. Text of agreement,https://codes.findlaw.com/ks/chapter-72-schools/ks-st-sect-72-60a01.html,"Article I. Purpose, Findings, and Policy.1. The states party to this agreement, desiring by common action to improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession. It is the purpose of this agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the states party to it, and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.2. The party states find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations. Variations from state to state in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other states. As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems. Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their states of origin, can increase the available educational resources. Participation in this compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.
Article II. Definitions.As used in this agreement and contracts made pursuant to it, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:1. “Educational personnel” means persons who must meet requirements pursuant to state law as a condition of employment in educational programs.2. “Designated state official” means the education official of a state selected by that state to negotiate and enter into, on behalf of that state, contracts pursuant to this agreement.3. “Accept,” or any variant thereof, means to recognize and give effect to one or more determinations of another state relating to the qualification of educational personnel in lieu of making or requiring a like determination that would otherwise be required by or pursuant to the laws of a receiving state.4. “State” means a state, territory, or possession of the United States;  the District of Columbia;  or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.5. “Originating state” means a state (and the subdivision thereof, if any) whose determination that certain educational personnel are qualified to be employed for specific duties in schools is acceptable in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.6. “Receiving state” means a state (and the subdivisions thereof) which accept educational personnel in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.
Article III. Interstate Educational Personnel Contracts.1. The designated state official of a party state may make one or more contracts on behalf of that state with one or more other party states providing for the acceptance of educational personnel. Any such contract for the period of its duration shall be applicable to and binding on the states whose designated state officials enter into it, and the subdivisions of those states, with the same force and effect as if incorporated in this agreement. A designated state official may enter into a contract pursuant to this article only with states in which the state official finds that there are programs of education, certification standards or other acceptable qualifications that assure preparation or qualification of educational personnel on a basis sufficiently comparable, even though not identical to that prevailing in that state official's own state.2. Any such contract shall provide for:
(a) Its duration.

(b) The criteria to be applied by an originating state in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving state.

(c) Such waivers, substitutions, and conditional acceptances as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract without sacrifice of basic educational standards.

(d) Any other necessary matters.
3. No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall be for a term longer than five years but any such contract may be renewed for like or lesser periods.4. Any contract dealing with acceptance of educational personnel on the basis of their having completed an educational program shall specify the earliest date or dates on which originating state approval of the program or programs involved can have occurred. No contract made pursuant to this agreement shall require acceptance by a receiving state of any persons qualified because of successful completion of a program prior to January 1, 1954.5. The certification or other acceptance of a person who has been accepted pursuant to the terms of a contract shall not be revoked or otherwise impaired because the contract has expired or been terminated. However, any certificate or other qualifying document may be revoked or suspended on any ground which would be sufficient for revocation or suspension of a certificate or other qualifying document initially granted or approved in the receiving state.6. A contract committee composed of the designated state officials of the contracting states or their representatives shall keep the contract under continuous review, study means of improving its administration, and report no less frequently than once a year to the heads of the appropriate education agencies of the contracting states.

(a) Its duration.


(b) The criteria to be applied by an originating state in qualifying educational personnel for acceptance by a receiving state.


(c) Such waivers, substitutions, and conditional acceptances as shall aid the practical effectuation of the contract without sacrifice of basic educational standards.


(d) Any other necessary matters.

Article IV. Approved and Accepted Programs.1. Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to repeal or otherwise modify any law or regulation of a party state relating to the approval of programs of educational preparation having effect solely on the qualification of educational personnel within that state.2. To the extent that contracts made pursuant to this agreement deal with the educational requirements for the proper qualification of educational personnel, acceptance of a program of educational preparation shall be in accordance with such procedures and requirements as may be provided in the applicable contract.
Article V. Interstate Cooperation.The party states agree that:1. They will, so far as practicable, prefer the making of multilateral contracts pursuant to Article III of this agreement.2. They will facilitate and strengthen cooperation in interstate certification and other elements of educational personnel qualification and for this purpose shall cooperate with agencies, organizations, and associations interested in certification and other elements of educational personnel qualification.
Article VI. Agreement Evaluation.The designated state officials of any party states may meet from time to time as a group to evaluate progress under the agreement, and to formulate recommendations for change.
Article VII. Other Arrangements.Nothing in this agreement shall be construed to prevent or inhibit other arrangements or practices of any party state or states to facilitate the interchange of educational personnel.
Article VIII. Effect and Withdrawal.1. This agreement shall become effective when enacted into law by two states. Thereafter it shall become effective as to any state upon its enactment of this agreement.2. Any party state may withdraw from this agreement by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until one year after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the governors of all other party states.3. No withdrawal shall relieve the withdrawing state of any obligation imposed upon it by a contract to which it is a party. The duration of contracts and the methods and conditions of withdrawal therefrom shall be those specified in their terms.
Article IX. Construction and Severability.This agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this agreement if declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States, or the application thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating therein, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters."

(a) It is the desire of the state of Kansas to promote communication, cooperation and collaboration between any military installation and any municipality adjacent to or surrounding the military installation.


(b) To further communication, cooperation and collaboration:

(1) Each military installation shall:

(A) Notify and coordinate with each municipality adjacent to or surrounding the military installation regarding any development, project or operational change on the military installation which will alter or amend a JLUS, ACUB, AICUZ or ENMP or any element therein.

(C) Meet and coordinate at least annually with representatives of each municipality adjacent to or surrounding military installations for the purpose of determining any critical area within the state area of interest.  A critical area of interest is any portion of the state area of interest where future use of such area is determined in a coordinated manner between the military installation and the municipality and should be monitored or managed to reduce any potential conflict with any military operation and the economic well being of the municipality.



(2) Each municipality adjacent to or surrounding a military installation shall:

(A) Meet and coordinate at least annually with the commander of the active duty, national guard or reserve military installation associated with the state area of interest in which the municipality is located to jointly determine what portion, if any, of that state area of interest is a critical area.


(B) Notify the commander of each military installation located adjacent to or surrounded by a municipality of any change in the name of any contact person, and any related information thereto, who is used for the purpose of communication between the military installation and the municipality.


(C) Provide notice to the commander of each military installation located adjacent to or surrounded by a municipality of the adoption of any regulation, including any amendment thereof, or any amendment to any comprehensive planning document which affects any mutually agreed upon critical area.  Such notice shall be provided at least 30 days prior to the adoption of any such regulation, or amendment thereof, or any such amendment to a comprehensive planning document.  Failure of an installation commander to respond after receiving notification under this subparagraph shall be deemed to indicate such commander's approval of the regulation, or amendment thereof, or amendment to the comprehensive planning document.


(D) Provide written notice to the commander of each military installation located adjacent to or surrounded by a municipality of each development proposal which affect any agreed upon critical area to provide the commander of any military installation affected an opportunity to assess any impact and coordinate issues with planning staff.  Such an assessment shall not be unreasonably withheld, but shall be offered within the statutorily required notice for public hearing.  Such notice shall be provided concurrently with any statutorily required notice for public hearing.


(E) Consider the impact of each of the following factors, based upon information provided by the installation, before making a decision regarding a development proposal located within an agreed upon critical area:

(i) The potential for release into the air of any substance such as steam, dust or smoke unless such substance is generated by agricultural use, that would impair visibility or otherwise interfere with military operations, including ground operations.


(ii) The potential for production of any light emission, either directly, or indirectly or by reflective light, that would interfere with pilot vision, and aerial or ground based night vision training.


(iii) The potential for the production of electrical emissions that would interfere with military ground and aircraft communications and navigation equipment.


(iv) The potential to attract birds or waterfowl including, but not limited to, operation of any sanitary landfill and the maintenance of any large scale feeding station.


(v) Whether or not structures are proposed within 10 feet of any defined aircraft approach, departure, or transitional surface;  or within 100 feet beneath any low-level military aircraft training route as provided by the federal aviation administration.


(vi) The potential to expose persons to noise greater than 65 DNL.


(vii) The potential for obstructed visibility or surveillance, or both, of direct fire weaponry platforms into permanently populated or operational areas of military installations.


(viii) Whether or not there will be a violation of any federal aviation administration height restriction in title 14 of the code of federal regulations (14 CFR) part 77 entitled “Objects Affecting Navigable Airspace” or Department of Defense Instruction (DoDI) Number 4165.57 entitled “Air Installations Compatible Use Zones.”



(F) Review and coordinate all comprehensive plans or zoning ordinances or regulations affecting any mutually agreed upon critical area of a state area of interest and consider the most current jointly developed community--military JLUS or AICUZ, or both, recommendations sponsored by the United States air force installation located at McConnell air force base located in Sedgwick county, Kansas, sponsored by the United States department of the army installations located at Fort Riley in or adjacent to Clay, Geary and Riley counties, Kansas, and Fort Leavenworth in Leavenworth county, Kansas, or sponsored by the Kansas adjutant general for Forbes Field in Shawnee county, Kansas, or the Smoky Hill facility located in Saline county, Kansas.  All such comprehensive plans or zoning ordinances or regulations shall also consider the presence of any ACUB and the findings of any AICUZ or ENMP.


(G) For such plans, ordinances or regulations, consider the recommendation or study provided by the military with a view to protection of public health, safety and welfare and maintenance of safe military and aircraft operations, and the sustainability of installation missions.


(H) Consider the adoption of a mandatory disclosure requirement for any property within any agreed upon critical area of a state area of interest, which would inform a buyer of the potential for impact from noise, smoke, dust, light, electromagnetic interference and aircraft safety zones on the landowner produced by normal military operations.


(I) Provide the following written notice to individuals receiving a construction permit for improvements within the agreed upon critical area:
“The property for which this permit is issued is situated in an area that may be subjected to conditions resulting from military training at a nearby military installation.  Such conditions may include the firing of small and large caliber weapons, the over flight of both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, the movement of vehicles, the use of generators and other accepted and customary military training activities.  These activities ordinarily and necessarily produce noise, dust, smoke and other conditions that may not be compatible with the permitted improvement according to established federal guidelines, state guidelines or both.”




(1) Each military installation shall:

(A) Notify and coordinate with each municipality adjacent to or surrounding the military installation regarding any development, project or operational change on the military installation which will alter or amend a JLUS, ACUB, AICUZ or ENMP or any element therein.


(B) Notify each municipality adjacent to or surrounding the military installation of any change in the name of any contact person, and any related information thereto, who is used for the purpose of communication between the military installation and the municipality.


(C) Meet and coordinate at least annually with representatives of each municipality adjacent to or surrounding military installations for the purpose of determining any critical area within the state area of interest.  A critical area of interest is any portion of the state area of interest where future use of such area is determined in a coordinated manner between the military installation and the municipality and should be monitored or managed to reduce any potential conflict with any military operation and the economic well being of the municipality.

Same;  regulations concerning subdivision of land in unincorporated area of county, procedure;  reservation of land for open space or recreation;  notice;  hearing;  amendment of regulations;  fees;  platting of subdivision, approval;  building permits;  naming and numbering streets",https://codes.findlaw.com/ks/chapter-19-counties-and-county-officers/ks-st-sect-19-2961.html,"
(a) The board of county commissioners, after the adoption of a comprehensive plan, may provide for the adoption, or amendment, of regulations governing the subdivision of land located within the unincorporated portion of the county in the manner, and for the purposes, provided by this act. Such regulations may provide for the harmonious development of the county, including the proper location and width of streets, and for building lines, open spaces, safety and recreational facilities, flood protection and floodplain regulations and for the avoidance of congestion of population, including minimum width, depth and area of lots and compatibility of design. Such regulations also may provide for the reservation or dedication of land for open space for either public recreational use or for the future use of the owners or occupants of subdivisions in order to insure a reasonable balance of use or design and to avoid the overcrowding of land. Such reservation or dedication shall be determined by the geometric design of the streets, lots, blocks or other natural features of the subdivision but such reservation or dedication shall not exceed 10% of the tract being subdivided, exclusive of streets, alleys, easements or other public ways. No owner of a tract being subdivided shall be prevented from offering more than 10% of such tract for such reservation or dedication nor shall the board of county commissioners be prevented from accepting such offering.
The subdivision regulations, as a condition to the approval of any plat, also may require and fix the extent to which and the manner in which streets shall be improved and water, sewer, drainage and other utility mains and piping or connections or other physical improvements shall be installed. Such regulations may provide that in lieu of the completion of such work or improvements prior to the final approval of the plat, the board of county commissioners may accept a completion bond, cashier's check, escrow account or other like security in an amount to be fixed by the board of county commissioners and conditioned upon the actual completion of such work or improvements within a specified period, in accordance with such regulations, and the board of county commissioners may enforce such bond, check or other like security by all equitable and legal remedies. In addition, the board of county commissioners may require a maintenance bond, cashier's check, escrow account or other like security in a reasonable amount to be in force for a period of one year following final county approval of such work or improvements.


(b) Before the board of county commissioners creates any regulations governing the subdivision of land located in the unincorporated portion of the county, the board shall require the planning commission to recommend to the board of county commissioners the regulations or restrictions.
The notice, hearing and voting procedures for adoption of the subdivision regulations shall be the same as that required for adoption of the comprehensive plan as provided by 
K.S.A. 19-2958
.
After adoption of the subdivision resolution, the regulations, restrictions or requirements contained therein may from time to time be supplemented, changed or generally revised by amendment. A proposal for such amendment may be initiated by the board of county commissioners, the planning commission, any zoning board or upon application of the owner of property affected.
The board of county commissioners may establish reasonable fees to be paid in advance by the owner of any property at the time of making application for any amendment.
All such proposed amendments to the subdivision resolution shall first be submitted to the planning commission for recommendation. All notice, hearing and voting procedures for consideration of proposed amendments to the subdivision resolution shall be the same as that required for amendments, extensions or additions to the comprehensive plan as provided by 
K.S.A. 19-2958
.


(c) Whenever any such regulations governing the subdivision of land under the provisions of this act are adopted, the owner or owners of any land located within the area governed by such regulations who: (1) subdivides the same into lots and blocks or tracts or parcels, for the purpose of laying out any subdivisions, suburban lots, building lots, tracts or parcels or (2) establishes any street, alley, park or public way intended to be dedicated for public use or for the use of purchasers or owners of lots, tracts or parcels of land fronting thereon or adjacent thereto, shall cause a plat to be made which shall accurately describe the subdivision, lots, tracts or parcels of land giving the location and dimensions thereof, or the location and dimensions of all streets, alleys, parks or other properties intended to be dedicated to public use or for the use of purchasers or owners of lots, tracts or parcels of land fronting thereon or adjacent thereto, and every such plat shall be duly acknowledged by the owner or owners thereof.
All such plats shall be submitted to the zoning board for that township in which such land is located for its consideration and, within 60 days thereafter, unless the regulations provide otherwise, its recommendation shall be submitted to the board of county commissioners for its official consideration and action. No such plat or replat or dedication of street, alley, park or public way shall be effective until filed with the register of deeds of such county as provided by law and no such plat, replat or dedication shall be filed with the register of deeds until such plat or replat or dedication shall have endorsed thereon the fact that it has been submitted to the zoning board and approved by the board of county commissioners, and that any land dedicated for public purposes has been accepted by the board of county commissioners.
The board of county commissioners may establish a scale of reasonable fees to be paid in advance to the secretary of the zoning board by the applicant for each plat filed with the zoning board.
No building authorization shall be granted for the construction of any structure upon any lot, tract or parcel of land located within the area governed by the subdivision regulations that has been subdivided, resubdivided or replatted after the date of the adoption of such regulations by the board of county commissioners but which has not been approved in the manner provided by this act. Any regulations adopted by the board of county commissioners with reference to subdividing lots shall provide for the issuance of building permits on lots divided into not more than two tracts without having to replat such lot, provided that the resulting tracts shall not again be divided without replatting, except as may otherwise be provided. Such regulations shall contain procedures for issuance of building permits on such divided lots which take into account zoning regulations, the need for adequate street rights-of-way, easements and improvement of public facilities, shall provide for a procedure which shall specify a time limit within which action shall be taken and also may provide for the final decision on the issuance of such building permit to be made by the board of county commissioners, except as may be provided by law.
Any regulations adopted by the board of county commissioners may provide additional or alternative review methods if a proposed plat is located in two or more townships.


(d) The board of county commissioners is hereby authorized to name or rename streets and to number and renumber business and residence addresses in the unincorporated portion of the county.

(a) Whenever any person has been found guilty of a crime and the court finds that an adequate presentence investigation cannot be conducted by resources available within the judicial district, including mental health centers and mental health clinics, the court may require that a presentence investigation be conducted by the Topeka correctional facility or by the state security hospital.  If the offender is sent to the Topeka correctional facility or the state security hospital for a presentence investigation under this section, the correctional facility or hospital may keep the offender confined for a maximum of 60 days, except that an inmate may be held for a longer period of time on order of the secretary, or until the court calls for the return of the offender.  While held at the Topeka correctional facility or the state security hospital the defendant may be treated the same as any person committed to the secretary of corrections or secretary for aging and disability services for purposes of maintaining security and control, discipline, and emergency medical or psychiatric treatment, and general population management except that no such person shall be transferred out of the state or to a federal institution or to any other location unless the transfer is between the correctional facility and the state security hospital.  The correctional facility or the state security hospital shall compile a complete mental and physical evaluation of such offender and shall make its findings and recommendations known to the court in the presentence report.


(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), whenever any person has been found guilty of a crime, the court may adjudge any of the following:

K.S.A. 22-4522
, and amendments thereto, whichever is less.
In imposing a fine the court may authorize the payment thereof in installments.  In releasing a defendant on probation, the court shall direct that the defendant be under the supervision of a court services officer.  If the court commits the defendant to the custody of the secretary of corrections or to jail, the court may specify in its order the amount of restitution to be paid and the person to whom it shall be paid if restitution is later ordered as a condition of parole or conditional release.
The court in committing a defendant to the custody of the secretary of corrections shall fix a maximum term of confinement within the limits provided by law.  In those cases where the law does not fix a maximum term of confinement for the crime for which the defendant was convicted, the court shall fix the maximum term of such confinement.  In all cases where the defendant is committed to the custody of the secretary of corrections, the court shall fix the minimum term within the limits provided by law.

The allocation and programming of funds within the state system in each fiscal year shall be according to need, as determined by a schedule of priorities assigned to segments of the existing highways which generally delineate the corridors of said state system of express highways and freeways. The secretary of transportation shall determine the length of each such segment in establishing said priorities, and the schedule of priorities shall be updated every four years on the basis of current criteria at that time.

(c) In constructing or reconstructing the state system of modern express highways and freeways established in this section, the secretary shall evaluate from time to time the feasibility of designating a portion or portions of any of the modern express highways and freeways within the system as a toll road. If the secretary shall determine that the designation of any such portion as a toll road is feasible, based on the projected traffic, engineering, cost and financing of the proposed toll road and a determination that adequate public funds for construction of such toll road are not available and that the construction of such toll road can be financed entirely through proceeds of the bonds issued pursuant to this act, the secretary shall submit to the legislature a recommendation that such portion be constructed as a toll road. The recommendation, together with any supporting information deemed necessary by the secretary, may be submitted with or as a part of the annual report required of the secretary in 
K.S.A. 68-2315
. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as abrogating, limiting or otherwise affecting any obligations or duties imposed upon the secretary of transportation under this section with respect to the construction, reconstruction, improvement and maintenance of the state system of modern express highways and freeways, including without limitation location studies, engineering, right-of-way acquisition and public hearings, nor shall it affect in any way the allocation, programming or priority of funds therefor.

K.S.A. 74-8819

(3) a person who has contracted with a simulcasting licensee to allow such licensee to display a simulcast race conducted by such person may receive compensation in the form of a percentage of or a fee deducted from the money received by the licensee from parimutuel wagers placed on such race if such contract is filed with the commission.

(q) Directors or officers of an organization licensee are not liable in a civil action for damages arising from their acts or omissions when acting as individual directors or officers, or as a board as a whole, of a nonprofit organization conducting races pursuant to this act, unless such conduct constitutes willful or wanton misconduct or intentionally tortious conduct, but only to the extent the directors and officers are not required to be insured by law or are not otherwise insured against such acts or omissions.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the liability of an organization licensee for damages in a civil action caused by the negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of its directors or officers, and a director's or officer's negligence or wrongful act or omission, while acting as a director or officer, shall be imputed to the organization licensee for the purpose of apportioning liability for damages to a third party pursuant to 
K.S.A. 60-258a
, and amendments thereto.


(r) If an applicant for an organization license proposes to construct a racetrack facility and the commission determines that such license should be issued to the applicant, the commission shall issue to the applicant an organization license conditioned on the submission by the licensee to the commission, within a period of time prescribed by the commission, of a commitment for financing the construction of the racetrack facility by a financial institution or other source, subject to approval by the commission.  If such commitment is not submitted within the period of time originally prescribed by the commission or such additional time as authorized by the commission, the license shall expire at the end of such period.

ARTICLE I PURPOSE


(a) The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the supervision of adult offenders in the community who are authorized pursuant to the Bylaws and Rules of this compact to travel across state lines both to and from each compacting state in such a manner as to track the location of offenders, transfer supervision authority in an orderly and efficient manner, and when necessary return offenders to the originating jurisdictions. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 
4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965)
, has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.


(b) It is the purpose of this compact and the Interstate Commission created hereunder, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states: To provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community;  to provide for the effective tracking, supervision, and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states;  and to equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.


(c) In addition, this compact will: Create a Interstate Commission which will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies which will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact;  ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;  establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators;  monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance;  and coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.


(d) The compacting states recognize that there is no “right” of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and there apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and By-laws and Rules promulgated hereunder. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

, has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.It is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to: (a) ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;  (b) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected;  (c) return juveniles who have run away, absconded or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return;  (d) make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services;  (e) provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles;  (f) equitably allocate the costs, benefits and obligations of the compacting states;  (g) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders;  (h) insure immediate notice to jurisdiction where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;  (i) establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact;  (j) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of Compact activities to heads of state executive, judicial, and legislative branches and juvenile and criminal justice administrators;  (k) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct non-compliance;  (l) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity;  and (m) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise. It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the formation of public policies and therefore are public business.
